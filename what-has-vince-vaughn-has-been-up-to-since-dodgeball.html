In Hollywood, however, the studios and audiences can be so fickle that bonafide movie stars can quickly find themselves on the outs for no real reason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At one time, it was abundantly clear that Vince Vaughn was one of the most popular and successful stars in Hollywood. Seemingly in the running for just about every highly sought after role that was up for grabs at that time, Vaughn’s future as a movie star also appeared to be secure. After all, Vaughn managed to headline several hit films and the tabloids covered <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his personal life</a> which is always a marker of stardom.</p><p>Amazingly enough, after a while on top of the acting world, Vince Vaughn’s star began to fade. In fact, these days there are many people who at one time would have considered themselves to be big fans of Vaughn who haven’t kept on his life and career. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, what has Vince Vaughn been up to?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Was Vince Vaughn To Starring On 'Friends'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rise-to-fame>Rise To Fame</h2><p>During the ‘90s, a slew of different movies that are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">required viewing</a> for movie buffs were released. While the titles on those lists can definitely be debated, it could easily be argued that Swingers should appear on all of them. An independent movie that starred a group of friends, Swingers introduced a lot of moviegoers to Vince Vaughn.</p><p>After Hollywood took note of Vince Vaughn’s Swingers performance, it quickly became clear that they saw him as a future leading man. After all, Vaughn went on to appear in one of the most anticipated blockbusters at that time, The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Additionally, during the late-‘90s Vaughn headlined movies like the remake of Psycho, Return to Paradise, and Made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Vince Vaughn’s career began to take off during the ‘90s, it wasn’t until he began to star in comedies during the 2000s that he truly became a star. Starting with the release of 2003’s Old School, Vaughn went on an incredible run of starring in some of the decade's most beloved comedies. After all, Vaughn would go on to headline movies like DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story and Wedding Crashers. If that wasn’t impressive enough, Vaughn also had small roles in other beloved comedies from that era including Zoolander and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 90s Movies Still Worth Watching (And 5 That Didn't Age Well)</a></span></p><h2 id=still-acting-after-all-of-these-years>Still Acting After All Of These Years</h2><p>Unfortunately for all of the fans of Vince Vaughn’s work during the ‘90s and 2000s, over the last decade, his stature in the entertainment industry has been diminished. That said, anyone that thinks that Vaughn hasn’t starred in any notable projects since the mid-2000s is sorely mistaken as that simply isn’t the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like a lot of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other movie stars</a> whose careers began to hit the skids, Vince Vaughn made the shrewd decision to begin appearing in several TV shows in recent years. For example, Vaughn has had recurring roles in shows like F is for Family and Curb Your Enthusiasm on top of starring in True Detective’s second season. When it comes to F is for Family, a lot of people don’t know this but Vaughn also has a behind-the-scenes role on the show as he is one of the series’ executive producers.</p><p>In addition to Vince Vaughn’s recent television exploits, he has continued to take roles in a long list of movies over the last decade. While many of Vaughn’s 2010s movies failed to make much of an impact, he does have some hits under his belt. For example, Vaughn had a role in the war drama Hacksaw Ridge, and one of his most recent movies, Freaky, performed well considering the pandemic. Some of Vaughn’s other notable 2000s movies include Delivery Man, Brawl in Cell Block 99, and Fighting with My Family.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vince Vaughn Dishes On Viral Trump Video And New Movie 'Freaky'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vaughn-s-personal-life>Vaughn’s Personal Life</h2><p>For the most part, the last decade in Vince Vaughn’s personal life has been a good one. However, an event took place in 2018 that got Vaughn in hot water and painted him in an extremely dangerous and disappointing light. While driving in Manhattan Beach, California, Vaughn passed through a sobriety checkpoint. After initially refusing to exit his car, Vaughn failed a field sobriety test and a blood alcohol test. After opting to plead no contest, Vaughn was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">convicted of reckless driving</a> and sentenced to three years of unsupervised probation, and ordered to complete a three-month alcohol program.</p><p>On a much brighter note, Vince Vaughn’s private life was filled with many triumphs during the 2010s. For example, Vaughn took up Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and after two years of training with Rener and Ryron Gracie, he managed to attain his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blue belt</a>. More importantly, over the last decade, Vaughn has built a family for himself starting with his 2010 marriage to a Canadian realtor named Kyla Weber. Vaughn and Weber also welcomed their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">daughter and son</a> into the world in 2010 and 2013 respectively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Sketchy Things Everyone Chooses To Ignore About Vince Vaughn</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWiv4yvoKeblWLDosHGoaVmoJGoeqOxxKdkrqhdqbxuv8inmp5llKSxqLHBmqOlZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-has-vince-vaughn-has-been-up-to-since-dodgeball.html&text=What%20Has%20Vince%20Vaughn%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20%27Dodgeball%27%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-has-vince-vaughn-has-been-up-to-since-dodgeball.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-has-vince-vaughn-has-been-up-to-since-dodgeball.html&title=What%20Has%20Vince%20Vaughn%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20%27Dodgeball%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-has-vince-vaughn-has-been-up-to-since-dodgeball.html&title=What%20Has%20Vince%20Vaughn%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20%27Dodgeball%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-has-vince-vaughn-has-been-up-to-since-dodgeball.html&title=What%20Has%20Vince%20Vaughn%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20%27Dodgeball%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-has-vince-vaughn-has-been-up-to-since-dodgeball.html&description=What%20Has%20Vince%20Vaughn%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20%27Dodgeball%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-are-the-finalists-of-love-island-uk-season-8.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are The Finalists Of Love Island UK Season 8?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vince-carter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vince Carter Net worth, Age: Bio-Wiki, Kids, Weight, Wife">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
