His death was confirmed on Monday, September 25, 2023, sending shockwaves through the hearts of those who knew him. The sudden loss of Bob Schifellite has left a profound void, and he will be deeply missed by all who had the privilege of crossing paths with him during his lifetime.</p><p>Bob Schifellite held a pivotal role as the leader of Broadridge’s Investor Communication Solutions business, overseeing critical aspects of the company, including the bank broker-dealer, corporate issuer, mutual fund and retirement, and customer communications solutions businesses. His journey with Broadridge began when the company became independent in 2007, and he went on to hold several executive positions within Investor Communication Solutions. Before joining Broadridge, in 1992, he joined ADP’s Brokerage Services Group, demonstrating his longstanding commitment to the financial sector.</p><p>As of the time of this report, specific details regarding the circumstances surrounding Bob Schifellite’s passing, including the exact cause of his death, remain undisclosed in the provided information. The public will be informed once further information becomes available.</p><p>Upon hearing the news of Bob Schifellite’s passing, many colleagues and acquaintances have come forward to offer their heartfelt condolences to his grieving family. Steve Meyer of Broadridge expressed his sorrow in a recent post, saying, “Came into work to some really horrible news, Bob Schifellite has passed away early Monday morning…!”</p><p>Bob Schifellite’s professional journey was marked by significant achievements and contributions. He held the position of Corporate Senior Vice President, Investor Communication Solutions, and served as the President of Investor Communication Solutions. Bob was a resident of Brentwood, New York, United States, until his untimely demise. His illustrious career included roles as the General Manager and Corporate Officer at ADP, Chief Operating Officer at The Independent Election Corporation of America, and Manager of Finance at Verizon. Prior to that, he worked as a Senior Auditor at Deloitte and Touche. Bob Schifellite pursued his education at Hofstra University, where he earned both a BBA and an MBA in Accounting and Finance.</p><p>Steve Meyer morns the death of Bob Schifellite. He&nbsp; stated in his post that:</p><p>Came into work to some really horrible news, Bob Schifellite has passed away early Monday morning…! First and foremost Bob was one of the pioneers that started Broadridge…! Bob was also a very outgoing guy that appeared to be interested in getting to know the people around him. In 2019 I was fortunate enough to get on that list, being on a first name basis and having random conversations as we passed each other in the halls. Our conversations were as if we were at a BBQ just getting to know each other. I had to pinch myself every so often to see if it was real. So as you can see developing this “friendship” was very special to me as well as motivating. Cause if I happened to bump into Bob, I’d have to be ready with an impressive update to share with him! It’s a shame that you were diagnosed only 3 weeks ago. RIP Bob! I hope to continue to impress you as you watch from above… Until we meet again!</p><p>Broadridge, a globally recognized Fintech leader with revenues exceeding $6 billion, plays a vital role in the financial industry by providing essential infrastructure to support investment, corporate governance, and communications. Their technology-driven solutions enable clients to navigate digital transformation and tackle today’s financial challenges while preparing for the opportunities of the future. Bob Schifellite’s contributions to Broadridge and the financial sector as a whole are a testament to his enduring impact on the industry.</p><p>The passing of Bob Schifellite is not only a loss to his family and friends but also to the financial community. His legacy will be remembered as a testament to dedication and excellence in the world of finance, and his absence will be deeply felt by those whose lives he touched.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kr7CujKyaoaGWmrmttdOeZKiamanCor7YZpmrp5GZv6qwxp5kqaqVqLalsc2tZJqmlGKwsL7PqKmarJVivKeyyJycq2WglsC0sdJmmLCZqWK2r3nBq5ynrKekvKV5zbJm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbob-schifellite-obituary-broadridge-president-and-corporate-officer-passes-away-in-brentwood-ny.html&text=Bob%20Schifellite%20obituary%3a%20Broadridge%20President%20and%20Corporate%20Officer%20passes%20away%20in%20Brentwood%2c%20NY&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbob-schifellite-obituary-broadridge-president-and-corporate-officer-passes-away-in-brentwood-ny.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbob-schifellite-obituary-broadridge-president-and-corporate-officer-passes-away-in-brentwood-ny.html&title=Bob%20Schifellite%20obituary%3a%20Broadridge%20President%20and%20Corporate%20Officer%20passes%20away%20in%20Brentwood%2c%20NY" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbob-schifellite-obituary-broadridge-president-and-corporate-officer-passes-away-in-brentwood-ny.html&title=Bob%20Schifellite%20obituary%3a%20Broadridge%20President%20and%20Corporate%20Officer%20passes%20away%20in%20Brentwood%2c%20NY" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbob-schifellite-obituary-broadridge-president-and-corporate-officer-passes-away-in-brentwood-ny.html&title=Bob%20Schifellite%20obituary%3a%20Broadridge%20President%20and%20Corporate%20Officer%20passes%20away%20in%20Brentwood%2c%20NY" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbob-schifellite-obituary-broadridge-president-and-corporate-officer-passes-away-in-brentwood-ny.html&description=Bob%20Schifellite%20obituary%3a%20Broadridge%20President%20and%20Corporate%20Officer%20passes%20away%20in%20Brentwood%2c%20NY" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./britney-spears-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-sons-move-away.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Britney Spears Reportedly Wants Another Baby Amid Divorce After Her Sons Move Away">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./15-beautiful-cars-ruined-by-women.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Beautiful Cars Ruined By Women">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
