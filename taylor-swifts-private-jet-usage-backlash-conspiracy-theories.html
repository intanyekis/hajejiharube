In fact, she traveled this way so often that Buzzfeed said that she "racked up more emissions on her own in just seven months than 1,184 average people would put out in a year." This information came from research that Yard did, and the study says that <strong>Taylor Swift was at the top of the list for C02 emissions</strong>.</p><p>People were upset to hear this because, as Yard found out, Swift often flew for just 80 minutes.

In November 2023, Us Weekly reported that Kelce could go to South America when Swift performs there as part of her extended Eras tour.</p><p>A source told Us Weekly, “Travis and Taylor are a very real couple, they actually spend a lot of one-on-one time together and have developed a very real connection.
