The holidays are coming, I want to enjoy myself,’” he says of his reason for quitting.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">“I wanted to see what it was like when … you only have 10-15 pounds to lose,” the plastic surgeon says of the trendy drug meant for type 2 diabetes patients but popular among celebrities for its weight-loss properties. <span class=credit>Casey Durkin/E! Entertainment</span></figure><p>“You go on vacation, maybe you don’t exercise, you eat too much,” the medical professional elaborates. “It was kind of like, ‘Well, I want to go on a food vacation,’ meaning I want to be able to eat again.”</p><p>Ozempic, an FDA-approved prescription drug, is one of the brand names for semaglutide — also known as Wegovy — which impacts the brain to maintain satiety and suppress one’s appetite.&nbsp;</p><p>Dubrow confirms that the medication killed his appetite and “really took … all the joy of eating away.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Dubrow says he stopped taking the medication because it “really took … all the joy of eating away.” <span class=credit>Trae Patton/E! Entertainment</span></figure><p>The doc — who is married to champagne enthusiast and “Real Housewives of Orange County” star Heather Dubrow — warns current and future users to stay away from alcohol.&nbsp;</p><p>“You can’t drink on it,” he asserts, acknowledging <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the reported danger of developing pancreatitis</a> for those taking Ozempic while also imbibing.&nbsp;</p><p>“You’ve got to be really careful with alcohol because people are being put in the hospital with pancreatitis.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Dubrow’s fellow plastic surgeon and “Botched” co-star Nassif says the rapid weight loss from taking Ozempic has caused an increase in patients wanting to remove sagging skin. <span class=credit>Casey Durkin/E! Entertainment</span></figure><p>Terry’s co-star, Nassif, 61, believes that Ozempic has properties that could eventually lead to “living longer,” but notes that he’s seen an uptick in plastic surgery patients wanting him to operate on sagging skin due to rapid weight loss.&nbsp;</p><p>“Your skin does not accommodate, so it hangs,” he says of what he calls “Ozempic body and face.”</p><p>“Then you lose muscle, you’re not taking enough protein and then they’ve got a lot of hanging skin.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">“Your skin does not accommodate, so it hangs,” the doc says of what he calls “Ozempic body and face.” <span class=credit>Casey Durkin/E! Entertainment</span></figure><p>Terry has also treated this issue in his practice. “For patients who want to try [Ozempic], you have to realize your skin is going to loosen up a lot faster,” he explains. “You are going to lose lean muscle mass. You have to increase your protein, you have to work out.”</p><p>On “Botched” Season 8, the duo addresses much more complex matters.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, on Thursday’s episode, viewers saw Terry and Nassif help a young woman who risked losing her left eye after 42 botched surgery attempts to repair her face following a tragic car accident when she was a teenager. They also lent their surgical skills to a patient who got a boob job after massive weight loss but was left with mismatched breasts.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">On “Botched” Season 8, the duo addresses much more complex matters.&nbsp;</figure><p>“When you’re on a TV show for a decade where all you’re doing is difficult cases, that becomes your whole practice in real life,” Terry says, describing the rare nature of his and Nassif’s careers in medicine. &nbsp;</p><p>“We have a skill set now that allows us to fix these incredibly difficult cases,” he enthuses. “What was formerly hard is now easy, and what was formerly impossible is actually mostly possible now.”</p><p>“Botched” airs Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET on E!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXOAjmloaGlpZLKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8COnalmrJWnv7p5w66Zq6enYsGztcSdZKiylaK9qq%2BMqqyirF2XsqSt1KycZqCVYrqqv9Kem2ain656sLKMnpitoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdr-terry-dubrow-tried-ozempic-quit-because-he-missed-joy-of-eating.html&text=Dr.%20Terry%20Dubrow%20tried%20Ozempic%2c%20but%20quit%20because%20he%20missed%20his%20appetite%3a%20Took%20the%20joy%20of%20eatin&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdr-terry-dubrow-tried-ozempic-quit-because-he-missed-joy-of-eating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdr-terry-dubrow-tried-ozempic-quit-because-he-missed-joy-of-eating.html&title=Dr.%20Terry%20Dubrow%20tried%20Ozempic%2c%20but%20quit%20because%20he%20missed%20his%20appetite%3a%20Took%20the%20joy%20of%20eatin" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdr-terry-dubrow-tried-ozempic-quit-because-he-missed-joy-of-eating.html&title=Dr.%20Terry%20Dubrow%20tried%20Ozempic%2c%20but%20quit%20because%20he%20missed%20his%20appetite%3a%20Took%20the%20joy%20of%20eatin" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdr-terry-dubrow-tried-ozempic-quit-because-he-missed-joy-of-eating.html&title=Dr.%20Terry%20Dubrow%20tried%20Ozempic%2c%20but%20quit%20because%20he%20missed%20his%20appetite%3a%20Took%20the%20joy%20of%20eatin" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdr-terry-dubrow-tried-ozempic-quit-because-he-missed-joy-of-eating.html&description=Dr.%20Terry%20Dubrow%20tried%20Ozempic%2c%20but%20quit%20because%20he%20missed%20his%20appetite%3a%20Took%20the%20joy%20of%20eatin" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./john-jakes-net-worth-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Jakes Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./was-oscar-wilde-gay.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Was Oscar Wilde Gay: A Look Into His Personal Life!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
