This includes one of the most beloved TV and movie stars living today...</p><h2 id=chris-brown-39-s-scandal-with-rihanna>Chris Brown's Scandal With Rihanna</h2><p>There's a lot to know about<a href=#> Chris Brown's criminal record and assault charges</a>. And they appear to continue to rack up alleged altercations on yachts. But all of this was sparked after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his notorious assault on Rihanna in 2009 </a>in his Lambourgini the night before The Grammys. Everyone saw photos of a beaten and bruised Rihanna and were rightfully furious with the rapper.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chris Brown Sued For Alleged Yacht Assault</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even Chris himself admitted to the incident, according to Grazia, saying, "Like I remember she tried to kick me, just like her beating s***, but then I really hit her. With a closed fist, like I punched her, and it busted her lip, and when I saw it I was in shock, I was ‘f***', why did I hit her like that? So from there she’s…spitting blood in my face, it raised me even more. It’s a real fight in the car, and we driving in the street."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the incident, Chris was sentenced to five years probation, six months of community service, and a year of domestic violence counseling. Not long after this, he won some roles in a couple of series and in films like 2012's Think Like A Man. Many questioned whether or not it was appropriate for Chris to still be working in the spotlight. But others supported his rehabilitation, including his Think Like A Man co-star, Taraji P. Henson.</p><h2 id=taraji-p-henson-39-s-relationship-with-chris-brown>Taraji P. Henson's Relationship With Chris Brown</h2><p>While promoting Think Like A Man in 2012, Taraji P. Henson (best-known for Hidden Figures, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, Hustle & Flow, and Empire) defended Chris' right cameo in the film. She was asked what she thought of Chris' involvement <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">by writer Jenni Miller at Vulture</a>. Taraji had this to say:</p><p>"I was happy for him because I know he really wants to act. You know, he’s trying to get into acting. I don’t dislike Chris Brown. I feel like we all have our skeletons. It’s unfortunate when you’re in the limelight the world gets to know about your dirty laundry, but as humans, we all have it, so for me to stand back and judge him and say that what he did was — is what he did wrong? Absolutely. I’m not condoning it. But what I’m saying is we have to allow each other to be human and we have to allow humans to make mistakes and to be big enough to forgive them. I guarantee you if you could give him those five minutes back, he would change it. If he could rewrite history, he would. But unfortunately, he’s human just like the rest of us. And there are things that I wish I could erase. But unfortunately, you can’t. You just gotta live and you gotta learn. Do I feel like he’s learned his lesson? Absolutely."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chris Brown Gets Slammed For Allegedly Leaving His Ex-Housekeeper Bleeding After His Dog’s Attack</a></span></p><p>When asked if she has received any flack for supporting him, Taraji said, "No. I support humans.

They pretty much dominate his IMDb page. However, when it comes to actual roles, he hasn't scored nearly as many as he wanted. Many believe that <a href=#>his horrible cameo on The O.C. ruined his shot at a successful Hollywood career</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an interview with MTV, Chris explained his role on the fourth season of the hit Fox series. "I play, like, a band geek — I'm really stepping out of my own character. I was kind of a geek in school, grade-wise. But style-wise, I was always popular and cool. But [on the show] I'm geeked out all the way. I'm just trying to be myself and then be the character [the role calls for]. I don't look at it like this role takes away from who I am."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chris Brown Leaks Scrapped Verse From Kanye West’s ‘Donda’ Album Amid Feud, And Fans Love It</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When talking about horrific cameos, Billboard.com spoke explained that while The O.C. writers didn't do much in the way with the character he played, who was opposite Willa Holland, Chris was "emotionless" in his performance.</p><p>After The O.C., Chris went on to earn small roles in This Christmas, The Suite Life With Zack And Cody, Takers, A House Divided, Battle Of The Year, and, of course, Think Like A Man with Taraji P. Henson. But nothing has really stuck or propelled him into stardom as an actor.</p><p>Fortunately for Chris, he's always had music to fall back on. While many likely still feel he should be canceled, some (like Taraji) believe he's paid his price. Regardless, it seems as though he will always have his successful music career.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Chris Brown Fans In Awe As His Daughter Gets Close And Personal With Exotic Animals</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqHqjvs6wpWaqmZ2ur7rAZqqcmZ6Zrq1505qpmqKZYr1utMSnqqimXZu%2FqrHNnaqhoaBk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchris-brown-rihanna-scandal-taraji-p-henson-friendship.html&text=This%20Famous%20Star%20Defended%20Chris%20Brown%20After%20His%20Horrific%20Scandal%20With%20Rihanna&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchris-brown-rihanna-scandal-taraji-p-henson-friendship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchris-brown-rihanna-scandal-taraji-p-henson-friendship.html&title=This%20Famous%20Star%20Defended%20Chris%20Brown%20After%20His%20Horrific%20Scandal%20With%20Rihanna" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchris-brown-rihanna-scandal-taraji-p-henson-friendship.html&title=This%20Famous%20Star%20Defended%20Chris%20Brown%20After%20His%20Horrific%20Scandal%20With%20Rihanna" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchris-brown-rihanna-scandal-taraji-p-henson-friendship.html&title=This%20Famous%20Star%20Defended%20Chris%20Brown%20After%20His%20Horrific%20Scandal%20With%20Rihanna" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchris-brown-rihanna-scandal-taraji-p-henson-friendship.html&description=This%20Famous%20Star%20Defended%20Chris%20Brown%20After%20His%20Horrific%20Scandal%20With%20Rihanna" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tommy-paul.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tommy Paul">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./patrick-dempsey-gets-facial-massage-from-wife-jillian-watch.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Patrick Dempsey Gets Facial Massage From Wife Jillian: Watch">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
