It happened during the game between New Orleans Pelicans.</p><p>The next day, NBA confirmed that the injury would be season-ending for Rubio. Despite the injury, he had put off an outstanding performance in the game. As a matter of fact, he scored 27 points, took 13 rebounds, and made nine assists.</p><p>However, he fell to the court and grabbed his knee when there were just three minutes left in the game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ricky-Rubio-helped-by-teammates-after-injury.jpg><p class=ue-c-article--first-letter-highlighted>Rubio has been a superstar for the Cavaliers over a short period of time.&nbsp;</p><p class=ue-c-article--first-letter-highlighted>He has been one of the key factors for the great 2021-2022 season of the Cleveland Cavaliers.&nbsp;</p><p>The injury has, however, already affected Rubio’s net worth.&nbsp;</p><h3>One assist shy of a triple-double&nbsp;</h3><p>Even after the slip, neither the Cavaliers nor their coach, J.B. Bickerstaff, was aware of the severity of the injury.&nbsp;</p><p>However, their fear turned into a nightmare once the MRI was revealed. It seems the point guard tore the same ACL he once tore back in 2012.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Cleveland-Cavaliers-Tweet-1024x597.png><p>With this injury and their loss to the Pelicans, Rubio has officially ended his season.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, the Spanish athlete has averaged 12.7 points and 6.5 assists this season. Not to mention, he was just one assist shy from making it a triple-double on Tuesday night.&nbsp;</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Ricard Rubio Vives, famously known as Ricky Rubio, is a Spanish basketball professional. Currently, he plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the National Basketball Association (NBA).&nbsp;</p><p>La Pistola was into high-level basketball from the early age of 14.

Eventually, he became the fifth-youngest player since 2000 to make a debut in the league.</p><h2>Professional Career</h2><p>Rubio kick-started his career in the Spanish ACB League in the 2005-2006 season with Joventut Badalona. Moreover, he was the youngest player to debut in the ACB league.</p><p>What’s impressive is that he achieved this feat at the age of 14 years and 11 months!

In November of the same year, Rubio scored 37 points and eight three-pointers in a career-high.&nbsp;</p><p>The Spanish basketball star is famously known for his assists.
