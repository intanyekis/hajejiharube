For those who are not so familiar with his name, it is enough to clarify that he is a boxer, son of a boxer and nephew of a boxer: his uncle was the World Boxing Champion Roger "Black Mamba" Mayweather.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Mayweather Jr. is more than boxing. It is said that currently he has 88 cars, although this figure usually varies depending on the athlete's cravings. The three Bugatti Veyron stand out, two of them are coupés and one in convertible version. Apparently one of those cars he wanted immediately and so he&nbsp;called his favorite supplier and demanded to have it in just 12 hours. Mission accomplished.</p><p>Mayweather Jr. is also someone who does not like credit cards.&nbsp;This gentleman is used to paying for his cars in cash: he arrives at the dealership with a bag full of bills. This has forced dealership owners to buy a counting machine only for when good old Floyd shows up there, after all when it comes to pleasing the undefeated boxing champion,&nbsp;all demands must be met.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bugatti-veyron-grand-sport-vitesse>Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse</h2><p>"This is Floyd's favorite," says one of the boxer's drivers proudly. 'Money', as many call him in the entertainment world, has three different versions of the same car. This French machine can easily be the best car in the world, as its 1,200 horsepower and an 8-litre turbo engine give it the title of one of the three fastest cars ever created, reaching 255 miles per hour, a speed that not even a Formula 1 is capable of achieving. The Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse is valued at about $3.5 million. A real joke for the bank account of the best-paid sportsman in history.</p><h2 id=he-enjoys-partying-in-his-yacht>He Enjoys Partying In His&nbsp;Yacht</h2><p>When the good old Floyd is very stressed out by having to choose from more than 80 cars at his disposal or when flying from one place to another on his personal plane is exhausting, there's nothing better than going to rest at the sea on a private yacht. If he wants to take a break, 'Money' comes to his yacht and enjoys the benefits of it. Wild parties, that's Mayweather's day-to-day life on his boat. It's a great day to be one of the friends of the former world boxing champion, because&nbsp; who doesn't mind spending money to be happy and also to make others happy. We're sure he never finds a shortage of friends to join him when it comes to enjoying life in his yacht.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-spectacular-14-rolls-royce>His Spectacular 14 Rolls-Royce</h2><p>Rolls-Royce's impressive fleet says a lot about the American boxer's obsession with British cars. Up to 14 Rolls-Royce of all possible models and configurations currently occupy his garage, including a limousine version of the stunning Rolls-Royce Phantom. Floyd&nbsp;was clearly not satisfied with&nbsp;owning the other iconic and more faithful models made by Rolls-Royce, which is why he opted to buy&nbsp;a limousine version too. The Rolls-Royce Ghost, synonymous with luxury, as Mayweather Jr. is, also appears in his collection. This automotive brand makes its cars for people like the boxer, have no doubt about that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-massive-gambling-lover>A Massive Gambling Lover</h2><p>The proverb says that money calls money and if you don't believe it, the clearest example is Mayweather's winnings from betting on sports. Mayweather is not measured in gambling expenses, one of his greatest passions outside the ring. He once bet $5.9 million dollars for the victory of Miami Heat (led by LeBron James and Dwayne Wade) over Indiana Pacers in the NBA playoffs in 2013. The boxer won 11 million dollars, however, he did not withdraw the money, but bet it back in the finals and won again. In the end he took 40 million dollars, enough money to completely renovate the cars in his garage.</p><h2 id=the-rare-kode57-is-a-sight-to-behold>The&nbsp;Rare Kode57 Is A Sight To Behold</h2><p>The American returned with another one of his eccentricities, this time still linked to cars yet again. Floyd Mayweather Jr. bought a Kode57, a new car for his collection, but this time with some particularities, as there are only five units in the world. This car was designed by the Japanese Ken Okuyama who created the Ferrari Enzo and the elegant Maserati Quattroporte. The Kode57 costs about $3 million, has a 6.0-litre V12 engine and a six-speed semi-automatic gearbox. According to Okuyama, the Kode57 was designed to honor the 1957 version of the car.&nbsp;Just what 'Money' likes, reviving the classics and adding them to his never ending car collection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bodyguards-are-a-must>Bodyguards Are A Must</h2><p>As if that were not enough, and although it seems unusual, considering that few would dare to attack Mayweather, he is permanently escorted by four bodyguards who, among them, reaches more than 1433 pounds of body mass. Among the most recognized are: Alfonso Redic, 7.0 feet high, responsible for being closer to the boxer, always on his left; Adam Plant, 6.6 ft., who is located on the right; and Pat Walsh, 6.4 ft. and Donald Monks, 6.2 ft., who watch from behind. All of them must be available 24 hours a day, and cannot work in parallel to protect other personalities. After all, Floyd is Floyd, and working for him is a luxury and probably very&nbsp;lucrative too. Even if it would cost you your life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=koenigsegg-ccxr-trevita>Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita</h2><p>The best boxer of recent times&nbsp;has another great pleasure thanks to the fortune he gets every time he steps into a ring. This time, the North American fighter bought the ultimate Swedish jewel:&nbsp;super sporty&nbsp;Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita. But this marvel of Swedish engineering is not for everyone. There are only three available in the world and only on request, of course. To achieve this, the world champion will need to sign a $4.8 million check (or bring money in bags full of Benjamins). The maximum speed of this car is 251 mp/h, and it can brake at 32 meters if its speed is 60 mp/h. This is achieved thanks to its amazing 4.8-litre and 4-valve Aluminium V8 engine.</p><h2 id=he-also-owns-a-ferrari-laferrari>&nbsp;He Also Owns A Ferrari LaFerrari</h2><p>Mayweather Jr. disbursed almost $10 million in two Ferrari LaFerrari. One red of&nbsp;$4 million and one white, personalized, costing $4.5 million. The boxer acquired two of the 499 copies that were manufactured in series of this model. That marked a new era in Maranello to be the first hybrid sports car of the legendary racing team. Known by its project name, F150, this limited-edition hybrid supercar was officially unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in 2013. There's one thing good Floyd should be recognized for: his&nbsp;great taste for super cars. But well, when the money is no problem, I guess taste is the least of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lamborghini-aventador>&nbsp;Lamborghini Aventador</h2><p>The Aventador was the car chosen by Mayweather Jr. for being the successor to one of the most formidable European super sports cars in history, the Lamborghini Murcielago, produced from 2001 to 2010. This is also the chosen car by Bruce Wayne (Batman) in the film 'The Dark Knight' when he didn't want to attract much attention. The Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 is a super sports car with two doors, produced by the Italian manufacturer Lamborghini in Sant' Agata Bolognese. Its engine&nbsp;includes a 6.5-liter 750 hp atmospheric V12 that allows it to reach a top speed of 230 mp/h and make 0 to 60 in 2.9 seconds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ferrari-enzo>Ferrari Enzo</h2><p>The Ferrari Enzo is a 2003 model car that was named after the founder of the brand from Maranello, Italy. It is one of the first cars with a honeycomb chassis (lightweight but robust), just like airplanes are built. Only 400&nbsp;models of the car were created in its two years of existence. To buy the Ferrari Enzo, retired boxer Floyd Mayweather had to put $3.3 million on the table. Yes, it's funny how paying millions of dollars to purchase a car for the 'Money' is exactly the same as paying for a six-pack of beer at the supermarket for us, the mortals, who were not blessed by the gods with one of the best defensives the&nbsp;boxing has ever seen in its history.</p><h2 id=he-also-loves-his-shoes>He Also Loves His Shoes</h2><p>In the wardrobe of his many mansions, the great Mayweather has hundreds of pairs of shoes in a box, many of which are&nbsp;still brand new. Many say the former boxer only wears a couple per day and doesn't put them back in his box again to collect them. Or sometimes he even gives them to&nbsp;his assistant or acquaintances. The boxer has exclusive cabinets for one of his favorite footwear brands: Christian Louboutin. For the boxer, it is the footwear that sets the trend for the rest of the clothes he will wear during that day. That's why it's no wonder he has more shoes than most Hollywood celebrities put together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mclaren-650-s>McLaren 650 S</h2><p>Presented at the Geneva Motor Show in 2014, Mayweather bought it without hesitation. A car created by American designer Frank Stephenson, perhaps one of the most influential automotive designers in history, who bases much of his work on biomimics, the science that studies biology and nature as a source of inspiration. The McLaren 650 S is the translation of all the years the British brand has been in competition. Under the hood sleeps a&nbsp; 3.8-litre V8 Twin-Turbo which, when it wakes up, develops 641 hp of pure power and 700 Nm of maximum torque. It was very difficult for this powerful four-wheel beauty to go unnoticed in the eyes of Mayweather Jr.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ferrari-458-italia-spider>Ferrari 458 Italia Spider</h2><p>The interior of this four-wheel convertible beauty was designed with contributions from former Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher, noting that most of the controls are on the steering wheel and not on the dashboard, as is the case with cars the German used to drive in his glory years. The cabin design, dashboard layout and aerodynamics are so neat that we could go up to 125 mp/h on the highway and have a conversation with our companion without the roar of the V8 or the rubbing of the air preventing us from doing so. As crazy as it sounds, this won't be the last Ferrari in the boxer's select fleet of cars.</p><h2 id=luxury-watches-are-a-must-too>Luxury Watches Are A Must Too</h2><p>The fighter also likes to decorate his wrists with exclusive watches. His collection is valued at more than 6 million dollars with pieces from brands such as Audemar Piguet, Rolex, Franck Muller, Aximums and much more. For 'Money', luxury is his holy grail. In one of his most recent whims, Floyd spent a million dollars on a luxury watch from Hublot Diamond Coated Watch, one of the most expensive watches on the market today. The boxer, very happy for his purchase, did not hesitate to make this watch one of his most precious accessories. Millions of dollars just in watches, a lifestyle that a guy like Floyd not only enjoys to the max, but rather feels proud of as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=porsche-911-turbo-convertible>Porsche 911 Turbo Convertible</h2><p>The 911, one of the flagship cars of the German brand, is a rocket inside and out, full of luxury and classic Porsche beauty. Just what a fighter like Floyd deserves. Inside it has a 540 hp engine that allows it to accelerate from 0 to 60 mp/h in just three seconds and reach 199 miles per hour of maximum speed. What better way to represent Floyd's infallible and fast features in the ring than with a 911 Turbo? Those who know the boxer, say that his 911 Turbo is one of his favorites. It is incredible to know what kind of&nbsp;features a car must absolutely possess in order to catch the eye of the&nbsp;former world champion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ferrari-599-gtb-fiorano>Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano</h2><p>Mayweather chose this car for his collection since it is one of the fastest cars the brand has ever built. It owes its name to the famous Italian racetrack. It is one of the latest models to have manual transmission with bar and clutch&nbsp;from Ferrari. The 599 GTB Fiorano is a GranTurismo sports car, has a front engine located in the center and rear-wheel drive, is made entirely of aluminium and is only available with a two-door coupe body. Its manufacturing period was from 2006 to 2012, which did not prevent it from taking its place amongst the best and most luxurious cars ever made.</p><h2 id=obviously-he-travels-in-his-own-private-jet>Obviously He Travels In His Own Private Jet</h2><p>Jet for private transportation. Yes, Mayweather doesn't need to take advantage of bargains or buy low-cost airline tickets. The retired boxer has a spectacular private jet at his disposal, ready for when he needs it. Floyd Mayweather Jr. has not hesitated to show the interior of his jet: fourteen genuine leather seats, which can be joined in packs of four to form a bed, games, bar, dining room, among other luxurious features. A small whim to travel comfortably and privately, without interruptions and without having to share flights with people you don't know and don't have to worry about their bad habits, like snoring.&nbsp;This plane has everything in the service of His Majesty. It's price? More than 45 million dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ferrari-f12-berlinetta>Ferrari F12 Berlinetta</h2><p>The last Ferrari on this list convinced Mayweather after a personal mechanical test that the boxer himself performed. Its 6,262-cubic centimetre, 65-degree, atmospheric V12 engine, with direct injection at 200 bar, provided the power needed with 740 horsepower at 8,250 revolutions and constant power from 8,700 rpm to satisfy the ex-champion's amazing pace of life. As with F1 engines, Ferrari ensures that this model has little inertia, so its revolutions increase very quickly. Mechanically and functionally, the F12 Berlinetta has no problem at all, as Floyd didn't when he bought it after his driving test.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mansion-in-los-angeles>Mansion&nbsp;In Los Angeles</h2><p>Mayweather obviously boasts&nbsp;his style and&nbsp;enjoys the purest luxury in Beverly Hills. Among many, there's one mansion that stands out when he acquired for about 25 million dollars, with an area of more than 1,300 square meters divided into two blocks. Mayweather loves to brag about his movie theater, one of the jewels of his home, characterized more by caprice than luxury. Through a video&nbsp;on Instagram, he bragged about his own 50-person cinema room, with comfortable sofas on the step so as not to impede vision. And even better: he showed how before entering the room, he has his own free "shop" where you can pick up popcorn and all kinds of snacks and chocolates.</p><h2 id=he-spends-his-time-counting-cash>He Spends His Time Counting Cash</h2><p>Another very beautiful and tender feature of the great Floyd is counting money. Mayweather lives not only from luxuries or eccentricities, but also from counting Benjamins. Through social networks, the retired boxer usually shows up counting money. Several bundles of bills accompany him in each of these images, who at times is alone with his money, but at other times also in the company of his friends.
