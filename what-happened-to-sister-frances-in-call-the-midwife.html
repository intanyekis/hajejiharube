The episode filled in as an impetus for season 12 and ended up being one of the most outstanding episodes of the show.</p><p>The episode had a few decent minutes, similar to the arrival of a cherished person and a great change to her life, however it likewise saw certain individuals leaving the show, leaving fans devastated.</p><p>One specific person we saw leave Poplar for a break from life at Nonnatus House was Sister Frances. In any case, what precisely befell her?</p><p>Disclaimer: This article contains spoilers from Call the Maternity specialist.</p><p>One of the most loved characters from Call the Maternity specialist is a medical caretaker named Sister Francis, played by Ella Bruccoleri. In the Christmas exceptional episode, Sister Francis was met with a sad mishap, because of which she won’t be seen on the show for quite a while.</p><p>This came after Sister Hilda, played by Fenella Woolgar, had proactively made her exit from Poplar. At the earliest reference point of the episode, we were implied that Sister Hilda had proactively left when Sister Frances asked Sister Julienne:</p><p>“Things being what they are, Sister Hilda isn’t returning by any means?”<br>To which she answered:</p><p>The caring Sister Francis quickly chose to get the missing Sister Hilda’s liabilities. Be that as it may, being a medical caretaker in those times wasn’t easy breezy. You never realized about the approaching calamities in that work, and this is precisely exact thing happened to her.</p><p>She was troubled with an excess of work between getting ready for the occasion and taking care of her maternity specialist obligations. She went out to take care of a mother in labor, however there were complexities after the conveyance. She then rode her bike through the snow to call Nonnatus House, which was replied by Attendant Lucille Anderson, played by Leonie Elliott.</p><p>Nurture Lucille informed Sister Frances that she would show up right away, and Sister Frances surged back to the mother in labor. She then, at that point, unfortunately tumbled off the bike and cracked her arm. Nurture Lucille then showed up to help the mother in trouble, and Sister Frances was taken to a medical clinic for an examination.</p><p>Sister Julienne, played by Jenny Agutter, later conceded that Sister Francis was stretched to the edge and something like this will undoubtedly occur.</p><p>Until further notice, Sister Frances has gone out to recuperate at Chichester. Fans adored her glow and will genuinely miss Ella Bruccoleri on the show.</p><p>In a discussion with the Express, a source from Call the Birthing specialist said:</p><p>“Ella and Fenella are off doing different things now – however that doesn’t mean they won’t return again sooner or later. They’ll both be missed.”What is Call the Birthing specialist about?</p><p>Call the Maternity specialist, which previously broadcasted in 2012, is a show that follows the existences of medical caretaker birthing specialists working in the East Finish of London in the last part of the 1950s and 1960s.</p><p>The show’s summary, as per IMDB, peruses:</p><p>“Narratives the existences of a gathering of birthing specialists living in East London in the last part of the 1950s to late 1960s.”<br>Made by Heidi Thomas, it depends on the Diaries of Jennifer Worth, a medical caretaker and maternity specialist who lived during the 1950s. The following season’s recording has authoritatively finished up, and episodes will start broadcasting in Walk 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl6tbuMrKCsrJWneqe%2BwKeanqtdnrtur8Clo2asmJp6rrXDsKCfnV8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-sister-frances-in-call-the-midwife.html&text=What%20happened%20to%20Sister%20Frances%20in%20Call%20the%20Midwife%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-sister-frances-in-call-the-midwife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-sister-frances-in-call-the-midwife.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Sister%20Frances%20in%20Call%20the%20Midwife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-sister-frances-in-call-the-midwife.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Sister%20Frances%20in%20Call%20the%20Midwife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-sister-frances-in-call-the-midwife.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Sister%20Frances%20in%20Call%20the%20Midwife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-sister-frances-in-call-the-midwife.html&description=What%20happened%20to%20Sister%20Frances%20in%20Call%20the%20Midwife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-did-allison-seymour-leave-fox-5.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why did allison seymour leave fox 5">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./parenthood-cast-where-are-they-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Parenthood Cast: Where Are They Now?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
