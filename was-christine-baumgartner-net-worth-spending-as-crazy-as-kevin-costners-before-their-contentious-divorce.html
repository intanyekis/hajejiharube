Their home was also littered with household help, which at a cost of $84,040.78 a year, ensured that their daily lives were effortless and comfortable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What The Cast Of Yellowstone Really Thinks Of Kevin Costne</a></span></p><p>The twosome also spared no expense when it came to gifts, showering themselves with lavish presents amounting to a jaw-dropping $830,504.51 in 2022 alone.</p><p>As if living like royalty in their sprawling mansions was not enough, Costner and Baumgartner also relished in the luxuries offered by prestigious Beach Clubs, which came with an annual price tag of $288,381.24.
