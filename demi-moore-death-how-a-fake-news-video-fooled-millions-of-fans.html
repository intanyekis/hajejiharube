The actress and producer was a victim of a death hoax, which was spread by a fake news video. The hoax was debunked by the actress and her representatives, who confirmed that she was fine. Here is the truth about the death hoax and how the actress is doing today.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Origin of the Hoax</h2><p>The hoax started from a YouTube channel named Allan Radio, which posted a video on February 24, 2024, claiming that they had received confirmation of Moore’s death. The channel also claimed that Moore had been suffering from a terminal illness and that she had died peacefully at her home. The video had no evidence or sources to back up its claim, and the comments were disabled.</p><p>Allan Radio is notorious for spreading death rumors of several other celebrities, such as Tom Selleck, Ann-Margret, Simon Le Bon, Anne Heche, and more. The channel has been widely criticized for its fake news and clickbait tactics. According to HITC, the channel has been trending online for the wrong reasons and has been reported by many users.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Reaction of the Fans and the Media</h2><p>As soon as the video of Moore’s death went viral, many fans and media outlets reacted with shock and sadness. Some expressed their condolences and tributes, while others questioned the validity of the report. Many celebrities and fellow actors also commented on the rumor, some expressing disbelief and others mocking the actress.</p><p>However, some fans and media outlets were skeptical and did some research to verify the claim. They found out that the video was a hoax and that Moore was alive and well. They also exposed the Allan Radio channel as a fraud and warned others not to fall for its lies.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Response of Moore and Her Representatives</h2><p>Moore and her representatives were quick to deny the false report and assure everyone that she was fine. According to Rolling Stone, Moore’s publicist said that the rumor was “completely untrue” and that the actress was “in good health”.</p><p>Moore herself also took to Twitter to address the hoax and thank her fans for their support. She wrote:</p><p>I am alive and well. Thank you for your love and support. God bless you all.</p><p>She also posted a video on Instagram, where she sang a snippet of her song “Landslide” and said:</p><p>I just want to say thank you for all of your love and support. I’m doing fine. I’m here at home, and I’m just enjoying life. And I want you to do the same. God bless you.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Current Projects and Plans of Moore</h2><p>Moore, who is best known for her roles in Indecent Proposal, Ghost, and A Few Good Men, is one of the most acclaimed and influential actresses of all time. She has won two Golden Globes, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. She is also the highest-paid actress to that point, receiving $12.5 million to star in Striptease.</p><p>The 61-year-old actress is still active and busy with her acting career. She recently starred in the limited series Feud: Capote vs. The Swans, where she played socialite Ann Woodward. She also appeared in the comedy film Corporate Animals, where she played a CEO who leads her staff on a team-building retreat. She also voiced Esmeralda in the animated film The Hunchback of Notre Dame.</p><p>Moore is also planning to star in the thriller film The Woman in the Window, where she will play a psychologist who witnesses a crime. She is also working on a sequel to her memoir Inside Out, which became a New York Times Best Seller.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Conclusion</h2><p>Demi Moore is not dead. The actress was a victim of a death hoax, which was spread by a fake news video. The hoax was debunked by the actress and her representatives, who confirmed that she was fine. Demi Moore is a living and successful actress, who is still making movies and entertaining her fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfmbKutYympqiqlWKxpq3ToWShp6dirm6ywKScZqaVrMBuwsidnKhllqS8rbHDZqSipJyevK%2B%2FjKidZp6Ro8Bw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdemi-moore-death-how-a-fake-news-video-fooled-millions-of-fans.html&text=Demi%20Moore%20Death%3a%20How%20a%20Fake%20News%20Video%20Fooled%20Millions%20of%20Fans&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdemi-moore-death-how-a-fake-news-video-fooled-millions-of-fans.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdemi-moore-death-how-a-fake-news-video-fooled-millions-of-fans.html&title=Demi%20Moore%20Death%3a%20How%20a%20Fake%20News%20Video%20Fooled%20Millions%20of%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdemi-moore-death-how-a-fake-news-video-fooled-millions-of-fans.html&title=Demi%20Moore%20Death%3a%20How%20a%20Fake%20News%20Video%20Fooled%20Millions%20of%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdemi-moore-death-how-a-fake-news-video-fooled-millions-of-fans.html&title=Demi%20Moore%20Death%3a%20How%20a%20Fake%20News%20Video%20Fooled%20Millions%20of%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdemi-moore-death-how-a-fake-news-video-fooled-millions-of-fans.html&description=Demi%20Moore%20Death%3a%20How%20a%20Fake%20News%20Video%20Fooled%20Millions%20of%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./love-is-blind-jessica-batten-pregnant-baby.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Expecting First Baby  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-david-meyer-de-rothschild-spends-his-10-billion-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Meyer De Rothschild Spends His $10 Billion Net Worth In Both Inspiring And Truly Outrageous Wa">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
