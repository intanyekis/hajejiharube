Little did the actress know that the show was not only created by Kaling but would catapult her into stardom and a world of Hollywood. <a href=#>By starring in the Netflix coming-of-age comedy series </a><i>Never Have I Ever</i>, Ramakrishnan has established herself as a prolific comedy actress portraying a relatable role while breaking racial stereotypes associated with her background. With the three hit seasons of the show with a final one on the brink, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan is developing her skills through the challenging character.</p><p>Known for her character of Devi, which has established a different fanbase for Ramakrishnan’s ability to portray the flawed character with perfection, the actress is slowly growing her empire and inspiring a new generation of South-Asian actors. Let’s look at the Maitreyi Ramakrishnan Story that took her from Canada to Netflix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=auditioning-for-fun>Auditioning For Fun</h2><p>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan’s parents moved from Sri Lanka to Ontario soon before the actress was born. Growing up in Canada, the young actress always wanted to hone her acting skills and learn new techniques. During high school, she played Velma in her high school’s musical production of <i>Chicago</i>, hoping to pursue acting in college. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a>, when graduation was around the corner, Maitreyi’s best friend forwarded her a tweet from Mindy Kaling about an open casting call looking for a young South-Asian actress for an upcoming role.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Mindy Kaling Story: How Kelly Kapoor From 'The Office' Built Her Empire</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a friend’s hangout, her group decided to film tapes and submit them for fun. In her <a href=#>first major production audition</a>, the actress went through several rounds and had to submit six tapes before she was flown into LA. She beat 15,000 other prospective applicants to bag the role of Devi Vishwakumar, a fifteen-year-old high school student at Sherman Oaks High, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle Canada</a>. Ramakrishnan got a chance to work and be friends with Mindy Kaling, the show's creator, who guided the actress throughout the filming of <i>Never Have I Ever</i>.</p><h2 id=making-her-screen-debut-with-netflix>Making Her Screen Debut With Netflix</h2><p>Shooting for the first season began in 2019 after Maitreyi graduated high school and moved to LA. When the show released its first season in 2020, fans worldwide were instantly enraptured by the Kaling-created series that showed the strength behind race representation and humor. Ramakrishnan felt empowered to be a voice through the character as she became an Asian leading lady for a teen comedy. As the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a> mentioned, the show's success surpassed expectations as the first season was viewed by 40 million member accounts worldwide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Netflix being an advocate for pay parity, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan saw a hike in her salary with every passing season of the show. The actress made only $21,000 per episode for the first season, comparatively less than the other experienced actors on the show. The second season saw her salary hiked to $26,250 per episode, while she received a $100,000 bonus before the show returned for its third season. By engaging audiences, Ramakrishnan also became a famous face on social media, as she has over 3.3 million followers on Instagram. There are various reasons for her rise to stardom, but one of the most central aspects has been the relatable character she portrayed on screen.</p><h2 id=a-relatable-protagonist-with-flaws>A Relatable Protagonist With Flaws</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan plays the role of an endearing yet awkward first-generation Indian-American in her family. While the actress never took acting lessons, <a href=#>she credits </a><a href=#><i>The Office</i></a><a href=#> for her comedic timing</a> and improv, a show where Kaling played the hilarious character of Kelly Kapoor and worked as a writer. While Ramakrishnan admitted that she put pressure on herself for being thrust into the spotlight, she slowly grew comfortable with the popularity and acceptance of her character.</p><p>No matter the race, gender, or background, Devi’s messy life experiences were universal. With the stunning writing of the show that made her go through cringe moments and awkward encounters, Devi became the representation of every teenager. <i>Never Have I Ever</i> has released three hilarious seasons of the show that only increases the fan base with every passing year. Ramakrishnan has already finished shooting its fourth and final season in August 2022 and said goodbye to her character, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marie Claire</a>. As new challenges await Ramakrishnan after her successful debut, the actress is ready to accept interesting roles head-on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan found her path through an open casting call, leading her to an exclusive Netflix series that ends with the fourth season in 2023.
