He then attended the Mississipi State University in 1989 from where he completed his graduation.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brooks_Ayers%E2%80%99s_Net_Worth_How_Much_Does_He_Earn></span>Brooks Ayers’s Net Worth: How Much Does He Earn?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brooks Ayers possesses an estimated net worth of around <strong>$150 thousand</strong>. He has gathered this wealth from the profit he makes in his various business ventures. Likewise, he also appeared in&nbsp;85 episodes of&nbsp; The Real Housewives of Orange County&nbsp;and for his part, he must have collected a good sum of money from it. Brooks, however, might have to lose some of his fortunes due to the ongoing controversial case with her ex-girlfriend, Vicky.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Great meeting <a href=#>@BallCoachJoeMo</a> last night while watching <a href=#>@HailStateMBK</a> win with <a href=#>@HAILSTATEREED</a> ! <a href=#>#HailState</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/qu4QWI5FWy</a></p><p>— Brooks Ayers (@BrooksAyers) <a href=#>February 24, 2019</a></p><p>Ayers is living a simple life.

The couple met during an insurance and investment conference in Atlanta in May 2007.

Their relationship did not work so well and they decided to split.</p><h3>Brooks Ayers’s Controversies: Is He A Controversial Man?</h3><p>Brooks Ayers is a man of controversy; he was arrested twice in Alabama and Mississippi for failing to compensate the supporting alimony to ex-wife Kim. Ayers was also taken to the court on the charges of owing over <strong>$40,000</strong> in the back child support.</p><p>Ayers was diagnosed with cancer which was a stage 3 Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in&nbsp;2013. However, many suspected him of faking the cancer diagnosis when he didn’t appear at the City of Hope in Duarte, California for the treatment of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2015. Brooks confessed that he purposely fixed all the chemo bills trying to prove that he has cancer.</p><p>Brooks cancer lies&nbsp;were so unbelievable that his own attorney ended up firing him over the fakery after he sold his forged cancer documents for <strong>$12,000</strong>.</p><p>Vicki Gunvalson has served her ex-boyfriend with a lawsuit over the <strong>$266,000</strong> he allegedly owes her. She hired a process server who successfully served her controversial ex-boyfriend. Vicky claims to have started loaning him money in 2011 after they began dating. Moreover, Gunvalson said Ayers still owed her <strong>$184,899</strong> and another <strong>$81,652.97</strong> for attorney fees she paid for him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brooks_Ayers%E2%80%99s_Body_Measurements></span>Brooks Ayers’s Body Measurements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brooks Ayers possesses&nbsp;a height of 5 feet 6 inches.
