However, it seems that the Crossroads star is not heeding their advice.</p><p>“Her assistants don’t want [Paul] around; they’ve made that clear from day one,” the second source went on. “She is such a sweetheart and generous by nature, but he doesn’t want anything. He isn’t in it for that and genuinely cares about her as a person. [But] her managerial team probably thinks he is out to do something shady.”</p><p>Britney has not responded to rumors that she wants to have another baby through a sperm donor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6Gko7K6edKpnJqqo2LEorrTrGSapp%2Bptaa%2BjJuYm7FdlrqqsIydoK%2Bnopiybr%2FOp6pmpZ%2Brsm6t1pqwaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbritney-spears-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-sons-move-away.html&text=Britney%20Spears%20Reportedly%20Wants%20Another%20Baby%20Amid%20Divorce%20After%20Her%20Sons%20Move%20Away&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbritney-spears-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-sons-move-away.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbritney-spears-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-sons-move-away.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20Reportedly%20Wants%20Another%20Baby%20Amid%20Divorce%20After%20Her%20Sons%20Move%20Away" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbritney-spears-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-sons-move-away.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20Reportedly%20Wants%20Another%20Baby%20Amid%20Divorce%20After%20Her%20Sons%20Move%20Away" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbritney-spears-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-sons-move-away.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20Reportedly%20Wants%20Another%20Baby%20Amid%20Divorce%20After%20Her%20Sons%20Move%20Away" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbritney-spears-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-sons-move-away.html&description=Britney%20Spears%20Reportedly%20Wants%20Another%20Baby%20Amid%20Divorce%20After%20Her%20Sons%20Move%20Away" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./408406-coco-lees-billionaire-husband-faces-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Coco Lee's Billionaire Husband Faces Cheating Rumors Following Her Death">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bob-schifellite-obituary-broadridge-president-and-corporate-officer-passes-away-in-brentwood-ny.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bob Schifellite obituary: Broadridge President and Corporate Officer passes away in Brentwood, NY">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
