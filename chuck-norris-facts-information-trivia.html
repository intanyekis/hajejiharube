Today, we give you a glimpse into his great life. Read on to find out 10 amazing facts about Chuck Norris you didn’t know about.</p><h2 id=his-name-isn-t-chuck>His Name Isn’t Chuck</h2><p>Well, to everyone’s amazement, Chuck Norris isn’t Chuck at all. His real name is actually Carlos Ray Norris. Although both his parents were Irish and Cherokee, he was named after a close family friend named Carlos.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Facts You Didn't Know About Morgan Freeman</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He received the nickname ‘Chuck’ while in the military serving overseas in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">South Korea</a> (reportedly it was actually ‘Ground Chuck) as military police.

While serving in the military Norris became interested in martial arts and took classes in Tang Soo Do and achieved a black belt. After leaving the military he moved back to the US and opened a martial arts studio. He started competing to bring attention to the business. He lost ten of his matches early on in his career, but after that, the graph just kept going up. Since 1968 he hasn’t lost a single fight. He finished his career as a competitor with a 168-10-2 record. This is why Chuck Norris is a legend in his field and is so popular even today.</p><h2 id=he-created-his-own-martial-arts-style>He Created His Own Martial Arts Style</h2><p>With karate being the main martial art that Chuck Norris is known for, it comes as a surprise to some people that he invented his very own style. His greatest achievement is the six straight titles at the Professional Middleweight Karate Championship. Once he had mastered karate and a couple of other martial arts, he wanted to try out something different. He created ‘Univeral Way,’ or Chun Kuk Do. He started teaching students this new martial art that he invented and it was a hit with them. So now in addition to karate, Chuck Norris has also built his legacy with a new martial art style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-trained-hollywood-in-the-art-of-karate>He Trained Hollywood In The Art Of Karate</h2><p>Chuck Norris trained many stars in Hollywood in the martial arts and became friends with <a href=#>Steve McQueen</a>, Donny and Marie Osmond, Bob Barker and Pricilla Presley.

When Lee died, Chuck Norris and Steve McQueen were two of the pallbearers at his funeral. Steve McQueen played a vital role in the life of Chuck Norris. He told him to start his acting career and we all know how great that decision was. The world came to know about Chuck Norris once he started to appear on the screen.</p><h2 id=he-is-a-taekwondo-8th-degree-black-belt-grand-master>He Is A Taekwondo 8th Degree Black Belt Grand Master</h2><p>Chuck Norris has several medals under his belt.

This also established his presence in the world. America knew him very well, but now the world learned about him too.</p><h2 id=adheres-to-a-personal-code>Adheres To A Personal Code</h2><p>When Chuck Norris started Chun Kuk Do, he attached <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a personal code</a> of 10 rules to live by. Number 4 simply says, “If I have nothing good to say about a person, I will say nothing.” This code is followed to a ‘T’ by Chuck. So, all those who love to talk to Chuck Norris also end up telling him a lot of their stories that will stay with him forever. Chuck has maintained a great regime with all his martial arts techniques. This helped him to have a great meditative mind and strong will power too.

His best-selling books include <i>Against All Odds</i><i>, Black Belt Patriotism: How to Reawaken America, The Justice Riders, </i>and <i>A Threat to Justice</i>. These books have become widely famous, putting him on the <i><a href=#>New York</a> Times</i> best-selling list. <i>Against All Odds</i> is an autobiographical novel that delves deep into his persona and his struggles to reach the top. Other books are in the self-help genre. Through Chuck Norris’ novels, you will get something gritty and strong and this will inspire you to reach for the stars too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-was-made-an-honorary-marine>He Was Made An Honorary Marine</h2><p>Seeing Chuck Norris in action, you would think he started strong from the very beginning. But Chuck was not one of those athletic students in school. Yet, he persevered and reached the top in martial arts. This started in South Korea when he was stationed as an air policeman in the United States Air Force. Chuck Norris was given the honorary title of Marine in 2006 by the Marine Corp for his support of the military branch and his campaign of Protect What You’ve Earned. The program was aimed at getting Marines to maintain their pride in their accomplishments as a Marine and avoiding behavior unbefitting the Marine Corp.</p><h2 id=he-was-a-spokesman-for-action-jeans>He Was A Spokesman For Action Jeans</h2><p>Since Chuck was into martial arts and everything, he knew what a good pair of <a href=#>jeans</a> meant for mobility. With his series, <i>Walker, Texas Ranger</i>, Chuck showcased that a good pair of jeans was perfect to fight crime in any situation. He crafted his own line of jeans called “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Action Jeans</a>” that were made from superior quality denim material. The cut and style of the jeans were perfect for any kind of movement, especially martial arts stances. Chuck Norris really was one great all-rounder who made the best of everything. It was probably the result of many pairs of torn pants while shooting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-is-a-philanthropist>He Is A Philanthropist</h2><p>With all the wonderful things that Chuck has done in his career, another feather in his cap is his philanthropy.

The organizations provide martial arts training to kids so that they learn discipline and respect from an early age. He also was part of the National Rifle Association to help oppose legislation on the restriction of gun ownership.
