Since then, the rumor mill has continued to spin, as <a href=#>fans just can’t stop obsessing over the former couple's adorable history</a>.</p><p>Jen and Brad both moved on to other relationships after their split. Brad and Angelina Jolie married in 2014 but separated only two years later in a highly publicized breakup. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">divorce, dubbed one of the nastiest in Hollywood history</a>, is still ongoing.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>Kimye, Brangelina And Other Celebrity Couples With Very Public Breakups</a></span></p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-has-since-remarried-and-divorced>Jennifer Aniston Has Since Remarried... And Divorced</h2><p>Most Brad/Jen fans know that their breakup seemed to coincide with Brad finding love with Angelina Jolie. Later on, the Friends star also moved on and married Justin Theroux in 2015. They divorced three years later, though they apparently remain friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fact that both Brad and Jennifer were now single again set social media ablaze, with fans speaking about hopes of a reunion between them. That means stories of a rekindling of their relationship keep surfacing.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Facts About Jennifer Aniston And Brad Pitt's Relationship Since Their Divorce</a></span></p><p>Most recently, reports that the exes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have been spending time together in the most romantic city in the world</a> have kept fans hoping for the long-awaited rekindling of the relationship.</p><p>In March 2022, a report in Woman’s Day carried a story about secret meetings between Jennifer and Brad in Paris. Jen was in the City of Love to film Murder Mystery 2, and Brad was there to sort out <a href=#>details around the wine estate he and Angelina jointly owned</a><a href=#>.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The story detailed that Jen was comforting Brad, who was struggling with the ongoing stress of the divorce proceedings.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Brad Pitt Is Accusing Angelina Jolie Of Sabotage</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for the fans, the tabloid was unable to produce any evidence of a meeting between the two.</p><h2 id=are-brad-pitt-and-jen-aniston-meeting-for-secret-rendezvous>Are Brad Pitt And Jen Aniston Meeting For Secret Rendezvous?</h2><p>There were also reports about another rendezvous between the two in Paris. According to Woman’s Day, the former couple had enjoyed a business lunch during which they talked about plans to join forces in Pitt’s Plan B company.</p><p>The tabloid reported that the meeting extended way beyond lunch and continued into the evening.</p><p>However, Naysayers are arguing that the Parisian Paparazzi, which followed Pitt’s every move, would surely have noted any liaison with Aniston. Especially because the photographers managed to snap Brad at other dinners.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Touch went even further. According to the publication, Brad and Jen had been staying together at a penthouse at the Four Seasons George V for months.</p><p>Unfortunately, the tabloid's story was a little adventurous with the dates in their report, because Jennifer had been in Hawaii until February, meaning she wasn't in Paris at the time.</p><h2 id=fans-still-want-brad-and-jennifer-to-reunite>Fans Still Want Brad And Jennifer To Reunite...</h2><p>Over the years, a wide variety of tabloids have featured a number of stories hinting at a reunion between the pair: One even told how Aniston and Pitt were planning a secret Mexican beach wedding. The writer pushed things a little too far when the report detailed the guest list, which included Aniston's ex, Justin Theroux.</p><p>Some of the stories have more credibility than others: The fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad was a guest at Jen’s 50th birthday bash</a> in 2019 certainly added understandable fuel to the fire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, the two star's support of each other at the 2020 SAG Awards drew renewed fervor from the Jen and Brad Reunion set. It was evident that the pair were incredibly proud of each other, and were very happy to see each other.</p><p>Fans also loved watching <a href=#>how Jen reacted when Brad won the Golden Globe in 2020</a> for his performance in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that no matter what, nothing will keep the fans from hoping, and the tabloid headlines about Jen and Brad's alleged international adventures continue to fuel that fire. Meanwhile, there doesn't seem to be any news of either party dating someone new, which means fans can continue dreaming.</p><p>The only remaining question is whether Jennifer would be open to dating Brad again, after all the heartbreak their prior relationship caused. But based on her reaction to seeing Brad at acting events, fans seem confident that Aniston would be willing to revisit their past romance, no matter the cost.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What Happened Between Johnny Depp And Jennifer Aniston?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdl7%2BisIypoK2sXZ%2Byr7rIn5yrZZGjtrTAzqdkoJ2kYq%2Bir8pmq6iflam1pr6O</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-get-back-together.html&text=Will%20Brad%20Pitt%20And%20Jennifer%20Aniston%20Really%20Reunite%3f%20Some%20Say%20It%27s%20Already%20Happened&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-get-back-together.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-get-back-together.html&title=Will%20Brad%20Pitt%20And%20Jennifer%20Aniston%20Really%20Reunite%3f%20Some%20Say%20It%27s%20Already%20Happened" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-get-back-together.html&title=Will%20Brad%20Pitt%20And%20Jennifer%20Aniston%20Really%20Reunite%3f%20Some%20Say%20It%27s%20Already%20Happened" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-get-back-together.html&title=Will%20Brad%20Pitt%20And%20Jennifer%20Aniston%20Really%20Reunite%3f%20Some%20Say%20It%27s%20Already%20Happened" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-get-back-together.html&description=Will%20Brad%20Pitt%20And%20Jennifer%20Aniston%20Really%20Reunite%3f%20Some%20Say%20It%27s%20Already%20Happened" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-about-genie-bouchard.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Things You Didn't Know About Genie Bouchard">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-sarunas-j-jackson-everything-to-know-about-the-actor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Sarunas J Jackson?
