McCurdy shared in the episode that after talking to her therapist, she knew that her "shame" over her early acting days wasn't gone.

Since she shared so much about her relationship with her mom, it makes sense that McCurdy would want the book to do really well. In fact, the book did so well that, in November 2022, Publishers Weekly reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McCurdy got a two-book deal</a> for two novels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Some Stories From 'I'm Glad My Mom Died" (According to Buzzfeed)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Jennette McCurdy had her own apartment at 18, but Debra McCurdy stayed over for a period of three months</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Debra wanted Jennette to only consume 1,000 calories daily</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Debra thought Jennette should act starting from the time she was 6</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=jennette-mccurdy-talked-about-mark-mccurdy-39-s-bad-behavior-at-her-mom-39-s-funeral><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jennette McCurdy Talked About Mark McCurdy's Bad Behavior At Her Mom's Funeral</span></h2><h3 id=episode-4-quot-loyalty-quot-october-31st-2023>Episode 4, "Loyalty," October 31st 2023</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jennette-mccurdy-smiling.jpg><p>It's fair to say that Jennette McCurdy's mom's behavior has affected how she thinks about the other family that she has. In the fourth episode of Hard Feelings, Jennette McCurdy explained that she was meditating on the concept of "loyalty." She said that she decided to stop talking to her father and grandmother and that she doesn't agree with being loyal to people just because they have been in her life.

According to Buzzfeed, she said in a Red Table Talk interview in 2022, "I would never want to have a child for my own identity."
