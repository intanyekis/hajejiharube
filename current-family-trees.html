I watched it on and off for years when I could. I remember a story line where John was the child of Stefano DiMiera’s father and Shawn Brady’s sister who later became a nun. So, John is Stefano’s half brother. Why is he looking for his mother? And Andre, wasn’t he Stefano’s nephew . He kidnapped Tony, (I think that was his name) Stefano’s son and kept him hostage on an island.</p><img alt width=20 height=20 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/p/7ba0ec/40.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> PAFan:<p>I just started to watch Days again ( I watched this show when Julie was Julie Olsen Banning) since it is now on at 8 pm on a cable channel.

So, John is Stefano’s half brother. Why is he looking for his mother? And Andre, wasn’t he Stefano’s nephew . He kidnapped Tony, (I think that was his name) Stefano’s son and kept him hostage on an island.</p><p>At some point, when we blinked too hard, John and Stefano didn’t share DNA. When this happened? I don’t know. I too clearly remember that John was Stefano’s half-brother. This is just another unexplained re-write/re-telling of John’s history.</p><p>Thanks everyone for the info, I love reading about all the background and such even if I’m clear on the details there’s always new bits to learn. I started watching Day’s back in the 90’s, and then would catch it here and there. Started watching again in 2009 on a regular basis (thank you DVR). Lately I just seem to be focusing on how everyone’s related and such.</p><p>I think it’s important to remember that whatever source consulted to check out a family tree, or bio for a particular DOOL character, may contain errors and/or omissions. That usually happens because the writers tend to surprize us with new characters at will–often previously unknown relatives. It must be hard for whoever compiles these sources to keep the information current! I have found the soapcentral website and our own Character Listings generally accurate, but in both of them I’ve found minor inaccuracies or information that should be updated (especially the addition of “new” relatives).</p><p>There are always ongoing Spoilers revealing that certain newcomers are due in Salem in the near future. We cannot expect those names to be identified in a Family Tree until they actually arrive. And it may take a while before we see their names listed–as it did on two sources that I know of–with Victor’s previously unknown second brother and nephew “Xander.” (I believe there’s to be still another Kiriakis relative sprung on us soon.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvCrqmrnZ6peqetzKKjsmWkp7Kmv45tam9waA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcurrent-family-trees.html&text=Current%20Family%20Trees%20-%20Days%20of%20Our%20Lives&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcurrent-family-trees.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcurrent-family-trees.html&title=Current%20Family%20Trees%20-%20Days%20of%20Our%20Lives" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcurrent-family-trees.html&title=Current%20Family%20Trees%20-%20Days%20of%20Our%20Lives" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcurrent-family-trees.html&title=Current%20Family%20Trees%20-%20Days%20of%20Our%20Lives" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcurrent-family-trees.html&description=Current%20Family%20Trees%20-%20Days%20of%20Our%20Lives" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./emerson-fittipaldi-wife-teresa-fittipaldi-is-an-artist-and-dating-fernando-silva-telles-with-no-marriage-in-mind.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emerson Fittipaldi Wife Teresa Fittipaldi Is An Artist And Dating Fernando Silva Telles With No Marr">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bobby-flays-girlfriend-christina-perezs-instagram-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bobby Flay's Girlfriend Christina Perez's Instagram Reveals What Their Relationship Is Really Like">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
