It's possible that Danielle hasn't met anyone that she cares about.</p><p>It's also possible that she hasn't been going on dates consistently. According to E! News, Danielle said in September 2022, "I don't think I'll be ready to date anytime soon. It takes me a long time to get over people. We're still going through the divorce process.

She said, "There's no real closure... Just getting divorced publicly without being able to talk to him, I didn't act the best."</p><p>When asked if they could ever date again, Danielle said "I'm going to be incredibly transparent about how immature I acted." She said "it's one of my biggest regrets." She also noted that if they did date in the future, she would hope that the people in his life would be okay with that because of how she acted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Cole Barnett From Love Is Blind Revealed His DMs Exploded With Proposals Following His Time On The Reality Show</a></span></p><p>Both Danielle and Nick have given interviews about how bad filming Love Is Blind was in terms of not having food, water, and mental health resources.

She said "You could feel the energy on the other side. It was funny, we would say that we would know that it was going to be the other person...
