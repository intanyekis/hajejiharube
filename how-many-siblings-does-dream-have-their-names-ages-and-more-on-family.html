Although his first name, “Clay,” was made public in 2021, his real identity is still a mystery.</p><p>His personal and actual identities are unknown to everyone because he hasn’t exposed his true identity and face. He has yet to share the other facets of his existence.</p><p>Dream became quite well-known in 2019 and 2020 and is well recognized for his Minecraft content creation, but in 2021 he was also accused of cheating while participating in a Minecraft speedrun. Without disclosing his true name, Dream rose to fame all around the world. He is also rumored to have siblings who use his account to play Minecraft as well.</p><p>Additionally, the vocalist and gamer YouTuber enjoys live-streaming on the platform, and his channel is among the fastest-growing ones. His YouTube channel has more than 30 million subscribers, and many people all over the world adore his content.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="What Are The Dream Siblings Like?">What Are The Dream Siblings Like?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Dream Family Members and Parents">Dream Family Members and Parents</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Dream And His YouTube Channel">Dream And His YouTube Channel</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-dream-siblings-like></span>What Are The Dream Siblings Like?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dream is an anonymous streamer, and it’s assumed that he has a younger sister who frequently uploads to YouTube.</p><p>The younger sister of Dream, who is 15 years old, is known as Drista. Her name is a combination of the words “Dream” and “Sista,” which TommyInnit gave her. Dream has also mentioned her in a few of his tweets, revealing that she enjoys Harry Styles and One Direction.</p><p>She has participated in numerous on-stream and in-video games on the Dream SMP using Dream’s account. The YouTubers Dream and GeorgeNotFound established the invite-only survival multiplayer (SMP) server known as Dream SMP. Dream’s sister acquired prominence following several visits to Dream SMP. She is her brother’s younger sister, at 15 years old, and they both live in Orlando, Florida.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dream-family-members-and-parents></span>Dream Family Members and Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dream has a younger sibling, but his identity, like his brother’s, is unknown. Along with that, Dream is also his sister’s younger brother. His older sister is by his side. But on top of that, nobody, not even his admirers, knows who his elder sister is.</p><p>Dream, who is 23 years old, was born on August 12, 1999. He became well-known thanks to his loyal fans, who helped him out often. Dream’s parents and other relatives are similarly hidden from view on the online platform because his identity has not yet been made public. According to the information on the internet, it can be inferred that he is obsessive about playing video games and streaming them on YouTube.</p><p>His family appeared to be supportive of his interests. Dream has been open about his condition since he was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Dream is an agnostic, which means, in accordance with Wikipedia, that he holds that neither the existence of God nor the essence of God can be known or understood.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dream-and-his-youtube-channel></span>Dream And His YouTube Channel<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On February 8, 2014, Dream started uploading videos to his YouTube channel. He enjoys popularity among his followers, as evidenced by his more than 30 million subscribers and more than 2.9 billion cumulative views.</p><p>Dream also has six additional YouTube accounts where he posts a variety of content concerning Minecraft. His other YouTube accounts include Dream XD, Dream Manhunt, Dream Team, Dream Shorts, Dream Tech, and Dream Music. He received the Streamy Award for Gaming from YouTube in both 2020 and 2021.</p><p>After 2019, Dream began consistently posting new content to his account. His earliest video, which is still available, features him purposefully playing Minecraft poorly in order to “trigger” people. As of August 2021, the video had over 17 million views.</p><p>Dream’s most popular and well-liked show is “Minecraft Manhunt,” and he also took part in competitions that helped generate about $3,400 for charitable causes. In 2021, Dream said that he had given The Trevor Project, a charity for LGBT kids, US$140,000 (US$90,000 from fan donations and US$50,000 from the Dream Team). Despite having a positive reputation, he has been linked to various cheating and fraud scandals, which has made him a contentious figure.</p><p>As a result of his success, the YouTuber has also been mentioned in a number of news stories. In January 2021, Business Insider Steven Asarch attributed Dream’s growth in 2019 and 2020 “to his understanding of the YouTube algorithm.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHqurc2yZKyhkqG2r7PSZpuonaNisbOxwKZkoZmmmnq1tMSiqWamkaKytHnAoJysZZGjsW65zqucZqeeYrOiucilsGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-many-siblings-does-dream-have-their-names-ages-and-more-on-family.html&text=How%20Many%20Siblings%20Does%20Dream%20Have%3f%20Their%20Names%2c%20Ages%20And%20More%20On%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-many-siblings-does-dream-have-their-names-ages-and-more-on-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-many-siblings-does-dream-have-their-names-ages-and-more-on-family.html&title=How%20Many%20Siblings%20Does%20Dream%20Have%3f%20Their%20Names%2c%20Ages%20And%20More%20On%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-many-siblings-does-dream-have-their-names-ages-and-more-on-family.html&title=How%20Many%20Siblings%20Does%20Dream%20Have%3f%20Their%20Names%2c%20Ages%20And%20More%20On%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-many-siblings-does-dream-have-their-names-ages-and-more-on-family.html&title=How%20Many%20Siblings%20Does%20Dream%20Have%3f%20Their%20Names%2c%20Ages%20And%20More%20On%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-many-siblings-does-dream-have-their-names-ages-and-more-on-family.html&description=How%20Many%20Siblings%20Does%20Dream%20Have%3f%20Their%20Names%2c%20Ages%20And%20More%20On%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kate-gosselins-son-collin-makes-insta-private-after-apparent-shade.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kate Gosselins Son Collin Makes Insta Private After Apparent Shade">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hellofresh-meal-kit-service-cooking-delivery-easy-recipes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="HelloFresh: Get 16 Meals Free With the No. 1 Meal Kit Service">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
