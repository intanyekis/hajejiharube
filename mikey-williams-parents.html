Despite being an exceptional player, Mikey’s father, at the same age as his son, was considered to be even better.&nbsp;</p><p>Mahlon was a star player and was expected to break records in the <a href=#>NBA</a>.</p><p>However, he got involved with gangs, eventually leading to his ten-month incarceration. Mahlon has acknowledged his past mistakes and encouraged his son to avoid negative influences.</p><p>In addition to being a former basketball player, Mahlon owns and operates two basketball organizations: So Cal Magic Elite Basketball Organization and Campton Magic Girls Organization.&nbsp;</p><p>His passion for the sport has translated into these ventures, which aim to allow young athletes to develop their skills and achieve their dreams.</p><p>Mikey, inspired by his father’s love for basketball and motivated by the desire to uplift his family, hopes to follow in the footsteps of his idol, LeBron James.&nbsp;</p><p>He aspires to create a similar atmosphere for his loved ones, just as James has done for his own.&nbsp;</p><p>With positive influences guiding him, Mikey has a better chance of achieving his goals and making it to the NBA.</p><p>Mahlon’s past mistakes serve as a cautionary tale for Mikey, reminding him of the importance of staying on the right path.&nbsp;</p><p>Mikey has the potential to do what his father couldn’t and fulfill his dream of becoming an NBA player. He has already made a name for himself in basketball, garnering attention from scouts and fans alike.&nbsp;</p><p>As he continues to hone his skills and develop his game, he is poised to impact the sport significantly.</p><p>Mikey Williams’s parents have been a driving force behind his success, with their support and encouragement serving as a constant source of <a href=#>motivation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Their athletic backgrounds have also influenced Mikey’s passion for sports, which has been evident since he was very young.&nbsp;</p><p>The guidance and support of Mikey Williams parents have helped him become one of the country’s most recognizable prep basketball players.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Mikey Williams?</h2><p>Mikey Williams, a basketball player from San Diego, California, was born on June 26, 2004, making him 18 years old as of 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>He comes from a family of athletes, with his father, Mahlon Williams, and his mother Charisse Williams, both having played sports in high school and university.
