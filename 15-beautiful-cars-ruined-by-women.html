They love them, care for them, nurture them, and primp them up to look their best. They’ll enhance them with fresh paint jobs, bodykits, rims, and accessories. Most car enthusiasts are extremely good at this. They’ll take a beautiful car, put in some love and dedication and turn it into a spectacular car. However, there are some car lovers out there who have crazy imaginations and it leads them to ghastly places. Places where it’s okay give your car eyelashes, or paint it revolting colours or vinyl wrap it with horrid patterns. Although both men and women are guilty of these absurdities, this list is dedicated to women and girly-inspired embellishments that completely ruined beautiful cars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If someone has enough money to spend on one of these bad girls, they’ll probably have enough money to make it look absolutely ridiculous too. The owners of the following vehicles spent way too much time playing with Barbie cars as kids and not enough time appreciating nice rides. Aside from that, we have some brats on our list too. Ladies who don’t appreciate nice cars to the point of physically destroying them.</p><p>We’ll be the first to admit, although this article lists “ruined” cars, a few of them are actually pretty neat. But, the cars who do not fall into those few are enough to make any car enthusiast cry and then stab their eyeballs out.</p><h2 id=15-pretty-jeep><strong>15. Pretty Jeep</strong></h2><p>newcarselloff.com</p><p>Jeeps are often known for being rough and tough off-roaders. Tons of women have opted for them which totally rocks. However, this woman took her pretty Jeep and made it look pretty cheap. When we say cheap, yeah sure it looks like a tacky car, but it also kind of looks like a cheap call girl. Not only did the owner give her jeep a Barbie-esque paint job, but she added terrible eyelashes onto it too— yes, car eyelashes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you may have noticed in parking lots everywhere, these car eyelashes are actually a thing, and apparently a big thing. They are sold in 92 different countries around the globe and have brought in around $3 million.</p><p>Car lovers are all for making their rides look good with some fancy accessories, but car eyelashes? Really? If you’re interested in making your car look like a pageant queen, you can get a pair of these glam embellishments for around $30 at a store near you.</p><h2 id=14-not-so-classic-mustang><strong>14. Not So Classic Mustang</strong></h2><p>stangtv.com</p><p>It took a lot of work to ruin what was once a beautiful classic 1967 Ford Mustang. It’s almost unrecognizable as a Mustang with it’s ugly pink and silver paint job, unnecessary blocky body modifications and missing emblem. It’s like this woman intentionally wanted negative attention for her whip. “Before” photos of this car are heartbreaking. In its prime this beauty was actually a coupe and looked like a real muscle car with a clean white paint job.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pictures of this customized Stang shocked car enthusiasts everywhere when it started making its rounds on social media. Users on Reddit were downright angry. “This should be a felony,” said one user.”More like life in prison,” replied another. One user even had the death penalty in mind, “We should execute them by dropping the car off of a 20 foot building onto their head.” Don’t mess with Stang lovers, people!</p><h2 id=13-snooki-s-escalade><strong>13. Snooki’s Escalade</strong></h2><p>starcasm.net</p><p><a href=#>Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi</a>, was known for a lot of things on the reality TV show, Jersey Shore. One of those things was her outrageous Jersey style, giant hair, and her wardrobe filled with animal prints and wacky colours. Not an aspect of her life was spared when it came to this style of hers, including her showy Cadillac Escalade. The ride was equipped with hot-pink ambient lighting, hot-pink rims and other hot-pink accents everywhere. The back of the truck where it should read “Escalade” Snooki had customized to read “Boss Lady”. For one more girly touch, she also added a Hello Kitty sticker to her back window.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the truck may be hideous, it actually sold on eBay for a staggering $77K! It was originally listed for $20K but Snooki fans kept the bids going up and up. Snooki added one more customization before saying goodbye to her ride, a white-inked Snooki autograph on the hood with a little heart dotting the “i” of course.</p><h2 id=12-six-second-smash-at-the-dealership><strong>12. Six Second Smash At The Dealership</strong></h2><p>theprivatelounge.org</p><p>We all know the stereotype that women are bad drivers. We also all know that this isn’t true, but unfortunately this lady gives all women drivers a bad name. Six seconds into a test drive at a Mercedes dealership was all it took for one woman to ruin a beautiful Benz GLE 350— a $60K car.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the blink of an eye the test-driver of the Mercedes had it completely flipped onto its side. She is thought to have mistaken the gas pedal for the brake pedal *face palm*. She sent the car launching forward, and if it wasn’t bad enough that she destroyed the Benz, she also smashed into four other cars including her own Hyundai crossover. Perhaps it’s a sign that she wasn’t quite ready to enter the realm of luxury cars. Luckily, no one was seriously injured in the roll-over. You break it, you buy it? We hope not for the woman’s sake.</p><h2 id=11-phony-prince-s-louis-vuitton-phantom><strong>11. Phony Prince's Louis Vuitton Phantom</strong></h2><p>autojunk.nl</p><p>What rich person doesn't love themselves some good ol’ Louis Vuitton. A handbag, perhaps? Some shoes, sure. Maybe some accessories too. But this luxury car owner took things to another level, a disturbing one. They took their Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe and turned it into a Louis Vuitton advertisement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What screams “RICH” more than a Louis Vuitton logo covered Rolls-Royce Phantom? Although this car gives off a very princess-y vibe, it is in fact owned by a Prince of some sort. This rainbow coloured LV Phantom is owned by German businessman Prince Marcus von Anhalt (not of any actual nobility). He certainly doesn’t seem like one to be humble about his wealth and here’s the twisted reason why: He actually bought his prestigious name for around $2 million as an adult by paying to be adopted by the von Anhalts and bear the name. It was a very odd thing to do but according to his ride, it seems to have worked.</p><h2 id=10-cheater-s-audi-r8-smash-up><strong>10. Cheater’s Audi R8 Smash-Up</strong></h2><p>mirror.co.uk</p><p>Infidelity is never okay, but here’s one rule of thumb: If you own a fancy sports car, don’t cheat on your wife. If losing your marriage isn’t enough to hurt you, maybe losing your $130K ride will be! The owner of this fancy red Audi R8 clearly did not know what he was getting himself into when he decided to have an affair. Or maybe he just thought he would never get caught.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At first glimpse, one might think this Audi was involved in some sort of traffic accident. But, a closer look reveals this wasn’t an accident at all. The entire exterior of the car was scratched with some sort of handheld instrument from front to back. Every window was smashed out along with exterior lights. The wife even took out her rage on the interior to be sure the car was totalled. She smashed up the dashboard and speedometer, she tore open the leather seats and ripped out all of the electrical equipment. She even scratched in a few loving words on the back of the car: “F*** you” and “Kiss my A**”.</p><h2 id=9-angry-at-an-audi><strong>9. Angry At An Audi</strong></h2><p>mirror.co.uk</p><p>This woman took her bad mood way too far and onlookers were there to capture it all on camera. She’d received a beautiful and expensive gift from her husband, a brand-new Audi Q7 worth about $100K. As it turns out, she didn’t like it. She allegedly thought it was too small for family use. Instead of politely explaining this to her husband (which let’s face it, wouldn’t be polite at all seeing as he just spent a fortune on her) she decided to have a temper tantrum instead and completely destroy it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With an audience of confused pedestrians, this woman took some sort of object and began smashing the Audi repeatedly. She broke the windows, scratched the doors and even smashed up the interior. What does she care, right? She didn’t buy it. We sincerely hope the husband gave himself a gift in light of the tantrum— a divorce!</p><h2 id=8-paris-y-pink-bentley><strong>8. Paris-y Pink Bentley</strong></h2><p>dramafever.com</p><p>Would we expect anything less from the Barbie Girl herself, <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a>? Back in 2008, she bought herself a $200K pink Bentley Continental GT. The pink-ness ranges all the way from the rims to the interior. But that’s not all, of course she had to have some bling too. The car has Paris Hilton touches all over it. The front emblem and rims are diamond-studded with “PH”s. Although it’s eight years old (a century in rich people time) Hilton still owns her Bentley. She brings it out the odd time when she’s not taking one of her other seven luxury rides for a spin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is surprising, but also not, that Miss Hilton would want such an eye-catching car. It’s not surprising because as everyone knows, she loves attention and the paparazzi chasing her. But, it is surprising because another thing everyone knows is her driving record. She was arrested in 2006 for driving under the influence of alcohol. And well, we have two words for that pink Bentley: Jail bait.</p><h2 id=7-crystal-lamborghini><strong>7. Crystal Lamborghini</strong></h2><p>dailymail.co.uk</p><p>Now, this entry all depends on how you view “ruined”. Although it’s not your typical looking exterior, we have to say this is pretty incredible. Japanese parts manufacturer, LYZER displayed this feminine work of art at the Tokyo Auto Salon 2016. The Lamborghini Murcielago is totally decked out with scissor doors, a luxury pink interior, pink and purple ambient lighting and covered from front to back in white and pink Swarovski crystals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We can’t imagine the amount of time and effort that went into the feminine transformation of this luxury car. It’s certainly fit for any girly-girl who enjoys the finer, more sparkly things in life. Too bad it’s only a demo, although it’s probably for the best. A blinged-out thing like this driving down the street would definitely be an eye-catcher. Maybe even to the point of being illegal? “Sorry officer, I didn’t mean to hit that pedestrian. I was blinded by that giant disco ball in front of me.”</p><h2 id=6-bape-bugatti><strong>6. BAPE Bugatti</strong></h2><p>luxury-design.com</p><p>This entry is a circumstance where a company took a love for their brand way too far. They took this Bugatti Veyron and turned it from beautiful to bogus. A Bathing Ape or BAPE is a Japanese streetwear brand. Their signature (almost similar to camouflage) design is what you see on this unfortunate pink Bugatti. Staying true to the Bugatti two-toned rule, they have BAPE pink and purple side panels along with bubblegum pink hood and rear panels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bugattis are as luxurious as cars come and range anywhere from $1.7 million to $2.7 million. It’s no wonder they attract the rich and famous who love to show off their wealth. Notable Bugatti owners include <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a>, <a href=#>Birdman</a>, <a href=#>Lil’ Wayne</a>, <a href=#>The Game</a> and <a href=#>Flo Rida</a> who sports his with an interesting paint job as well— gold chrome. Why would anyone want to take a car like that and Barbie-fy it? We have no idea.</p><h2 id=5-flamed-mercury><strong>5. Flamed Mercury</strong></h2><p>arabaresim.net</p><p>This vintage 1949 Mercury Coupe was the victim of a terrible paint job. Flamed paint jobs are pretty cheesy, but the “Merc” is very familiar to such tomfoolery. People have been customizing them with fiery paint jobs for decades. But, this vehicle’s powdery orange base and purple flame look landed it on our list as another beautiful car ruined by a woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mercs have made many notable appearances in popular culture. They have been iconic for decades, known for being turned into rebel hot rods. Films you’ve seen them in include: Rebel Without A Cause (1955), Badlands (1973) and Cobra (1986). It’s also been animated in the movie Cars (2006) as a Mercury Police Cruiser. Last but not least, who could forget the custom 1949 Mercury, Hell’s Chariot driven by the Scorpions in Grease (1978). None of these pop culture references lead us to believe this beautiful classic car was meant to have a girly touch; and certainly not one like this.</p><h2 id=4-crazy-caddy><strong>4. Crazy Caddy</strong></h2><p>autoevolution.com</p><p>This Cadillac SRX is just ridiculous. The owner took modifications to a laughable level. This bad girl has 34-inch wheels, a chrome pinky-purple paint job and an all pink interior. What is with those wheels? It looks like something straight out of Willy Wonka. Maybe they’re used to hypnotize onlookers into thinking this car is actually attractive. If all of those features weren’t enough to draw attention, the grill and other silver accents on the SUV are actually bejewelled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite what its look may suggest, this crazy Cadillac does not belong to a woman. It belongs to rapper, Hell Rell. I guess a simple black and chrome look was too run-of-the-mill for him. We wonder, where he got his inspiration. A Girlfriend? A beet perhaps?</p><h2 id=3-cotton-candy-camaro><strong>3. Cotton Candy Camaro</strong></h2><p>mecum.com</p><p>To quote 90’s pop group, Aqua, we think the owner of this car must have been “A Barbie girl in a Barbie world”. A world where she thought it was okay to destroy this beautiful Camaro. When solid pink is too mainstream girly, you have to add in some accents with the next best colour— Tiffany blue, of course. When you mix barbie pink and Tiffany blue together you get the recipe for the girliest paint job of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This Camaro is totally cotton-candied out from front to back, outside to inside. The interior is colour coordinated through and through with pink and blue gator seats, a pink and blue dash as well as pink and blue carpets. It looks like something straight off of Pimp My Ride with 32-inch floater wheels and coming equipped with four TVs and a Playstation 3. It ain’t pretty, but it sure would be worth a pretty penny.</p><h2 id=2-barbie-hummer><strong>2. Barbie Hummer</strong></h2><p>nocarnofun.com</p><p>Before we get into this vehicle's girly-ness, we have to remember what Hummers were actually used for. They weren’t used for rich people to parade around in, and they certainly weren’t used to be ruined by pink paint jobs. The original Hummers were used in the United States Army coming totally endowed with military equipment. They were meant to be high mobility multi-purpose vehicles that could follow the tracks of full-sized army trucks. But then in 1992 when civilians got hold of the heavy-duty vehicles, they basically became used for show boating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Someone took this beastly Hummer and turned it into a pretty in pink chick-mobile. It looks like something a bunch of tipsy bridesmaids would be stumbling out of for a bachelorette party. Who would have the audacity to take a military-style vehicle and make a mockery of it with this horrid paint job? A Barbie girl, that’s who!</p><h2 id=1-minty-z><strong>1. Minty Z</strong></h2><p>f2esh-WordPress.com</p><p>This entry was customized by a guy, possibly with some influence from a girlfriend? Nonetheless it’s still girly and not all girly cars can be pink, that would just be boring. Here we have a Nissan 350Z appropriately named Minty Z, a nice sports car that was ruined by a bad paint job. The exterior gleams a minty-green hue and is accented with hot-pink rims. Although the owner is probably a sports car fanatic, this ride looks like it should be driven by a Valley girl who doesn’t know what a throttle is.</p><p>Fun fact: Almost an exact replica of this car was made in the video game Grand Theft Auto 4. So even if you’re a little too embarrassed to sport the car in real life, you can sport it virtually instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>autoblog.com</a>, <a href=#>sheknows.com</a>, <a href=#>dailymail.co.uk</a>, <a href=#>wikipedia.com</a>, <a href=#>celebritycarsblog.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrZ2TnbuwuM6goJ6rX2aCbq7EmqytoZaquW6vwKuqZqqlnrumsIybsGavn6Kyr3s%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-beautiful-cars-ruined-by-women.html&text=15%20Beautiful%20Cars%20Ruined%20By%20Women&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-beautiful-cars-ruined-by-women.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-beautiful-cars-ruined-by-women.html&title=15%20Beautiful%20Cars%20Ruined%20By%20Women" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-beautiful-cars-ruined-by-women.html&title=15%20Beautiful%20Cars%20Ruined%20By%20Women" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-beautiful-cars-ruined-by-women.html&title=15%20Beautiful%20Cars%20Ruined%20By%20Women" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-beautiful-cars-ruined-by-women.html&description=15%20Beautiful%20Cars%20Ruined%20By%20Women" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bob-schifellite-obituary-broadridge-president-and-corporate-officer-passes-away-in-brentwood-ny.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bob Schifellite obituary: Broadridge President and Corporate Officer passes away in Brentwood, NY">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sugar-ray-leonards-pacific-palisades-estate-hit-the-market-for-45-million.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sugar Ray Leonard's Pacific Palisades Estate Hit The Market For $45 Million">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
