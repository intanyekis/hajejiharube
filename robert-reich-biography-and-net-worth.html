Reich was diagnosed with it as a youngster. His illness made him a target for bullies as a child. He frequently looked to bigger lads for protection, Michael Schwerner being one among them. Schwerner was one of the three civil rights activists assassinated in Mississippi in 1964 by the Ku Klux Klan. Later, Reich credited this incident with inspiring him to seek a career in public service.</p><p>Reich attended Cross River, New York’s John Jay High School.
