It surprised everyone when it became equally as popular as going to the movies. Television has continued to evolve and innovate. It’s become much more cinematic in the approach. At one time there were only a few channels with the big networks being NBC, ABC and CBS. There is now a plethora of ways to watch one’s favourite series. TV shows are a crucial part of some people’s lives. Some shows still air weekly and can’t be missed. Fans rush home each week to watch the newest episode. For others it’s easier to binge-watch an entire series in a single weekend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been numerous great TV shows since the first show hit the airwaves. Some series last several seasons and are on the air for years. In fact, some of those shows are still producing new episodes.

Homeland stars <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Claire Danes</a> and Mandy Patinkin. The first season was universally praised and the series was called one of the best new shows of 2011. However, over the years the series has declined in both quality and ratings. Some fans and critics feel the series has passed its prime. It’s still doing better than most shows and every single time <i>Homeland</i> seems down for the count it gets right back up. The series has been renewed for a 7th and 8th season with the 8th expected to be the final season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dead-like-me-too-soon><strong>Dead Like Me (Too Soon)</strong></h2><p>pinterest.com</p><p><i>Dead Like Me</i> had a small but loyal fanbase that loved the series.
