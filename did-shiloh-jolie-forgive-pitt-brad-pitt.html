That, in conjunction with his absence from their lives as a result of not having custody for a time, has led to major repairs needing to be done to patch things up between Pitt, Shiloh, Zahara, Maddox, Pax, Vivienne, and Knox. Unfortunately, with some of the kids, the damage done may be beyond repair.</p><p>In 2020, it was reported that Pitt's relationship with Maddox had not been repaired since the incident on the plane. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The relationship between Pitt and Maddox was "non-existent."</a></p><p>"With Maddox overseas [for college], Brad is also hopeful that Pax will also be interested in reconnecting without the influence of his older brother," a source stated.

"You have no consideration or empathy toward your four youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence. You will never understand the damage you have done to my family because you're incapable of doing so."</p><p>Approximately a week before that Instagram post was leaked, Zahara attended a sorority event with Jolie by her side. At the event, Zahara had to introduce herself to the room. <a href=#>When Zahara introduced herself, the surname "Pitt" was left off of her name</a>.

This has been speculated to be because they were so young when the marriage between Pitt and Jolie ended that they do not recall any of the less happy times in the household.</p><p>While there were years when Pitt was away from them because of sole custody being given to Jolie, since he has been awarded joint custody, Pitt has the twins in his care as much as Jolie does, suggesting that while all may be lost with Shiloh and Pitt's other children, the twins might still be close with their dad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqLWquM6hZKOnnJ6ybrLOq56irpVivarA02aZq5mUYr2qwNNo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-shiloh-jolie-forgive-pitt-brad-pitt.html&text=Shiloh%20Jolie%20Pitt%20Forgave%20Dad%20Brad%20Pitt%2c%20But%20Fans%20Think%20There%27s%20More%20To%20The%20Story&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-shiloh-jolie-forgive-pitt-brad-pitt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-shiloh-jolie-forgive-pitt-brad-pitt.html&title=Shiloh%20Jolie%20Pitt%20Forgave%20Dad%20Brad%20Pitt%2c%20But%20Fans%20Think%20There%27s%20More%20To%20The%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-shiloh-jolie-forgive-pitt-brad-pitt.html&title=Shiloh%20Jolie%20Pitt%20Forgave%20Dad%20Brad%20Pitt%2c%20But%20Fans%20Think%20There%27s%20More%20To%20The%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-shiloh-jolie-forgive-pitt-brad-pitt.html&title=Shiloh%20Jolie%20Pitt%20Forgave%20Dad%20Brad%20Pitt%2c%20But%20Fans%20Think%20There%27s%20More%20To%20The%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-shiloh-jolie-forgive-pitt-brad-pitt.html&description=Shiloh%20Jolie%20Pitt%20Forgave%20Dad%20Brad%20Pitt%2c%20But%20Fans%20Think%20There%27s%20More%20To%20The%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sol-rodriguez-from-star-trek-picard-family-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Sol Rodriguez From Star Trek: Picard?
