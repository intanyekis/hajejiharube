Speaking of the budget, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenRant</a>, this film boasts a budget of $200 million, nearly five times the budget of the 1984 film and that doesn't even account for each actor's salary. Staying on the subject: who has the highest net worth among the cast?</p><p><strong>Updated on December 3, 2021, by Michael Chaar:</strong> Dune was easily one of the biggest films of the year, with a cast that is worth tuning in for. While there are tons of big names attached to the flick, including Josh Brolin, Oscar Isaac, and Timothee Chalamet, their net worths vary considerably. Timothee, who leads the film, is now worth an impressive $10 million, while his co-star, Zendaya has a net worth of $15 million. When it comes to taking the cake, it is actually Stellan Skarsgard who is worth the most, with a whopping net worth of $50 million. Luckily for Josh Brolin, his $45 million net worth doesn't put him too far behind!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rebecca-ferguson-net-worth---6-million><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Rebecca Ferguson Net Worth - $6 Million</span></h2><p>It's almost ironic to think that Rebecca Ferguson - who plays Chalamet's mother in the film - shares the same net worth as her onscreen son, but at the same time, it's not hard to understand why that may be the case.</p><p>Both have spent the past couple of years being on that same trajectory of rising the ranks in Hollywood and both started that trajectory at relatively the same time. When Call Me By Your Name hit theaters in 2017, Ferguson was first introduced to mainstream audiences two years earlier with a breakout role in Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, and has since amassed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $6 million.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=timoth-eacute-e-chalamet-net-worth---10-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Timothée Chalamet Net Worth - $10 Million</span></h2><p>We kick this list off with the star of the film, who not only leads the ensemble cast as its key figurehead but also leads (or loses?) the race with the lowest net worth on the list. Well, at the very least, he has it tied with someone else, but dead last is still dead last.</p><p>Chalamet has been on course to becoming one of Hollywood's biggest leading men today ever since his breakout starring role alongside<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Armie Hammer </a>in Call Me By Your Name three years ago. Dune should cement his status among the Hollywood elite, all while allowing him to amass a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $10 million.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-did-timoth-eacute-e-chalamet-get-paid-for-39-dune-39><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>How Much Did Timothée Chalamet Get Paid For 'Dune'?</span></h2><p>Considering he was the film lead, it's no surprise that Timothée went on to earn quite the paycheck! While he's on the way to becoming one of the biggest actors in Hollywood, he's still got some ways to go before reaching Leonardo DiCaprio, George Clooney, and Johnny Depp status. Well, despite his age, the actor is still making the big bucks, in fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Timothée was paid $2 million</a> for his appearance in Dune.</p><h2 id=oscar-isaac-net-worth---10-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Oscar Isaac Net Worth - $10 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's jump to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar Isaac</a>, who has been a leading man in Hollywood ever since his own breakout role in the 2013 Coen Brothers picture, Inside Llewyn Davis, which earned Isaac his first Golden Globe nomination and was the catalyst to him amassing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $10 million.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Actors Have Said About Working On The Mission Impossible Franchise</a></span></p><p>From there, he joined the Star Wars sequel trilogy as Poe Dameron, and he's been off to the races ever since.

He's quickly earned a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $16 million.</a></p><p>After appearing in a string of sci-fi action thrillers like Blade Runner 2049 and Hotel Artemis, the ex-grappler now proceeds to add Dune to his continually growing resume.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=javier-bardem-net-worth---20-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Javier Bardem Net Worth - $20 Million</span></h2><p>Javier Bardem is another long-tenured actor approaching legend status who is more than deserving of their accolades and high net worth. In his case, the three-time Oscar nominee (one-time winner) holds a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $20 million</a>.</p><p>He doesn't let it go to his head though. Penelope Cruz's spouse continues to be humble about his superstar status in both America and Spain. Rather than just sit on his cross country cash and call it a day, he dedicates his free time to environmental activism.</p><h2 id=josh-brolin-net-worth---45-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Josh Brolin Net Worth - $45 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Josh Brolin has become something of a workaholic over the course of his 36-year acting career.
