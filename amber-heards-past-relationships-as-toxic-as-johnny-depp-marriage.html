Heard was much younger at the time, being only 22 years old, while Tasya Van Ree was 32, but their passion was so intense that Heard legally adopted Van Ree's last name. At the time, <a href=#>Heard was rising to prominence in her movie career</a>. But her fame would soon be shrouded in a veil of negative publicity following an alleged altercation with her then girlfriend.</p><p>Amber Heard was arrested for domestic violence in 2009 following an incident that took place at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.

While this is quite damning evidence against Heard, let's see if the pattern persists in her other relationships.</p><h2 id=was-amber-heard-39-s-relationship-with-elon-musk-toxic><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Was Amber Heard's Relationship With Elon Musk Toxic?</span></h2><h3 id=elon-musk-net-worth-241-2-billion>Elon Musk Net Worth: $241.2 Billion</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Does-Amber-Heard-Feel-About-Elon-Musks-Twitter-Takeover_.jpg><p><a href=#>Amber Heard's relationship with tech billionaire Elon Musk</a> began in 2016. Of course, Heard was adamant that their romance officially commenced after both her divorce with Depp and Musk's divorce from then-wife Talulah Riley was finalized. But that only came after allegations were made that Heard was seeing Musk while still married to Depp - such a messy love triangle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nevertheless, their romance soon grew unstable, and by August 2017, Amber Heard and Elon Musk called it quits. But they apparently couldn't commit to their split either, and reunited five months later, only to split for good by February 2018. Although they both claimed the split was due to their hectic schedules, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">new biographical book described Elon Musk's relationship with Heard as a 'dark vortex'</a> that was 'brutal'. Musk's family, especially his brother Kimbal, felt that Heard was toxic, and that Musk often "falls in love with these people who are really mean to him."</p><h2 id=was-amber-heard-39-s-relationship-with-vito-schnabel-toxic><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Was Amber Heard's Relationship With Vito Schnabel Toxic?</span></h2><h3 id=vito-schnabel-net-worth-10-million>Vito Schnabel Net Worth: $10 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/amber-heard.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If there's one thing that can be said about Amber Heard is that she seems to have an abundance of options and romantic interests. After her divorce from Johnny Depp was made official in 2017, and her on-and-off relationship with Elon Musk came to an end in 2018, within three months she was rumored to be dating Vito Schnabel. Although Schnabel was not a famous actor like Depp or a tech billionaire, as an art dealer and founder of Vito Schnabel Gallery, he was making decent money.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/amber-heard-oonagh-hat.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Amber Heard's Daughter Was Born Via Surrogate, Here's Why She Kept That Private</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Why did Amber Heard decide to have her baby daughter Oonagh through a surrogate and why hasn't she spoken much about this part of her life?</span><p>According to The Mirror, Amber Heard made her romance with Vito Schnabel public in July 2018 while attending the Wimbleton Tennis Championships in London together. However, by March 2019, the relationship was said to have ended "because of long-distance."

But, whether she was going through a liberation phase from her divorce or not, she didn't stay a full year without a new man at her side. After her relationship with Vito Schnabel fizzled out in March 2019, she struck up a new romance with Argentine filmmaker, Andres Muschietti.</p><p>Amber Heard kept trying to make sparks fly, this time with Andres Muschietti, another accomplished suitor. He directed both <a href=#>Stephen King's film adaptation, It and It: Chapter 2</a>, which were box office successes. However, as with many of her previous relationships, their short-lived romance came to a close at the end of 2019. There were no reports from Muschietti of any toxic behavior during their time together.</p><h2 id=was-amber-heard-39-s-relationship-with-bianca-butti-toxic><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Was Amber Heard's Relationship With Bianca Butti Toxic?</span></h2><h3 id=relationship-timeline-january-2020---december-2021>Relationship Timeline: January 2020 - December 2021</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-design-3.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amber Heard seemed to have reverted to once again looking for love in the same gender, telling from her announcement in January 2020 to being in a relationship with cinematographer Bianca Butti. As with her previous relationships, Heard was caught sharing a passionate kiss with Butti in Palm Springs, California, which signaled the start of her new romance. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sources reported that Heard looked happier than ever</a>, and that Butti was very supportive of her, especially following Johnny Depp's defamation lawsuit against her in 2019.</p><p>One year into their relationship, Amber Heard announced in July 2021 that she had given birth to her daughter, Oonagh Paige Heard, using a surrogate. Heard made it clear that Butti was not part of her new motherhood journey, and that she would be both the mom and dad of her daughter. But after nearly a two-year relationship, Heard and Butti ended their relationship, again due to long-distance, as Heard was stationed in the UK for the filming of Aquaman 2. Perhaps she needs to occupy herself with raising her daughter and give relationships a break for now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-amber-heard-currently-dating-anyone><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Is Amber Heard Currently Dating Anyone?</span></h2><h3 id=highest-grossing-film-aquaman---1-1-billion>Highest-grossing Film: Aquaman - $1.1 Billion</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-design-4.png><p>Since her split with Bianca Butti, there have been no reports of Amber Heard seeing anyone new.
